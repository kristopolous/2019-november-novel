3 Reign and conquest
--------------------

Technology's companion has always been discovery. Discovery is a controversial word because it implicates relationships that are inherently contextual and usually denies a side of agency. This can be resolved through a polemical distinction. For instance, "In 1492, the native americans and europeans discovered each other" places agency back into both parties. 

Doing this requires a nuance and complexity. A kind of detail that reaps deep rewards.

Discovery's companion word is invention and the process of all of them surround relationships and objects, whether material or not and of assigned agency.

Tomorrows are intrinsically dependent on their ontological mileu. Discoveries for this conversation, which is about imagining and actualizing utilization requires a notion of othernewss. An idea that there is a "there" there which can be manipulated through godmaking acts.

The connection of imperialism, enlightenment, and the scientific revolution coming from the same countries, at the same time constitute what some have called "the age of discovery".

This isn't an apologetics for the brutality of imperialism or some defense of the moral bankruptcy of the actors but it's to analytically see a long arc from the renaissance to the present along the mileu of conquest; control, ownership, and dominance. Often mistaken, often immoral, but also one of the best forms of tomorrow we have.

Projects of ethnonationalism occupied minds as much as the sci-fi fantasies of today.  At the time that they both existed and were culturally acceptable, between about 1860-1940, they were often interconnected in narratives of the future.

As opposed to a materialist perspective on this, which is covered in many texts, this is about understanding how ethnonationalist imperialist projects were about projecting.
