## Universal Access is the Accelerant

> The future is already here â€“ it's just not evenly distributed.  
*William Gibson, The Economist, 2003.*

What is termed "Digital Out of Home (DOOH)" programmatic, essentially electronic billboards, is often called an emerging field. As of the writing of this, here's how it works:

 * SSP - Supply side platforms are the people who own the screens and built, or at least controls the technology that runs on them
 * Ad Network - A supply of SSP "real-estate" for sale usually from multiple SSPs. The number, location, and description of the platforms is part of this. SSPs can be on multiple Ad networks. 
 * Ad Exchange - A broker managing a consolidation of different ad networks to help maximize the reach
 * CPM - The impression unit, essentially the thing being bought and sold, the eyeballs.
 * RTB - A real-time bidding marketplace run by an ad exchange
 * DSP - A demand side platform for managing assets on Ad exchanges and facilitating in RTB on behalf of brands and agencies.

Essentially someone has clients with ads. They find places to put the ads within their budget and a bunch of middlemen act as layers between the physical device and the customer.

The other purpose here is to be a flexible stack that allows advertisers to target and retarget segments and potential customers essentially following them around throughout their day.

That dumb ad that keeps coming up from that website you were on for 5 minutes? This is the architecture that enables that.  Connecting the online space to the physical space so that the advertiser can stalk you Even More, is seen as The Next Big Thing.

Here's some problems with this system:

 * No consumer wants it: It's been around more or less since the 90s and people still hate it.
 * It's a priesthood of wonkiness: There's about a dozen SSPs, Networks, Exchanges, and DSPs out there along with about another dozen acronyms. It's likely *the most complicated and unintelligible way to advertise*. The industry is awash in middlemen agencies that exist between every step and sometimes even a second tier of more finely tuned middlemen agencies between them.
 * It assumes an advertiser either has the time or the money to hire someone to deal with all of this.

This system works for say billboards, where they sometimes cost $50,000/month, each!  A multi-million dollar advertising campaign can have all of these, sure.

But if you are in that class why would you bother with screens on top of cars? It could be part of a large strategy, maybe ... if you can get established players comfortable with new technology, but the sales there are hard. 

This sounds like a classic test case in any book where they talk about the small scrappy firm that played by different rules and changed the game. We could choose to be another SSP, go on an ad network, get content from the exchanges, collect our checks and go home.  There's a number of firms that tried this and they are all in tough times. Most of them are out of business. 

That's because there's 2 dimensions to advertising:

| . | Captive | Non-captive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single User | Back of a taxi cab, before a youtube video | Television, Cell phone |
| Multi-User | An elevator, before a movie | Billboard, DOOH |

Each one is fundamentally different in how things are sold and who you are selling to. The system above is for single-user non-captive, this is multi-user non-captive, which means retargeting works differently, segmentation works differently, it's a different beast.  There's a different value system and thus, likely a different market.

Additionally the traditional value systems of digital ads don't exist in DOOH:

 * Low accuracy of reporting: Various firms are trying to attach cameras to do eyeball tracking.
 * Low audience attention: Size, nits, resolution, placement, are all factors that people use to try to address this.
 * Low specificity of audience: SSPs are trying to target things like PoS terminals so they can do audience slicing better.
 * Low provability: Since the vehicle is moving, it's hard for the SSP to prove to anyone else in the chain that the ad played when they report it as played back up to the network.

Even though DOOH is bad at these things, the industry, as a whole, doesn't seem to be interested in trying something else. Instead they are trying to cram this round peg into that square hole at whatever level of exhaustion is necessary to get there. They'll occasionally do a subversive tactic around these systems as direct sales but it's to the same customer, promising the same things, just without the architecture to back it up. So they build it out bespoke on a per advertiser basis. Dumb...

The technology is fundamentally disruptive but it's being stuffed into a box labeled "sustaining" and force-fed to established markets of "late majorities" (see crossing the chasm)

Somehow, much to everyone's shock, this does not work very well and the Customer Acquisition Cost is quite high while the Lifetime Value is quite low.  Established players are usually only interested in pilots and because the smaller market (of the DOOH supply) can't really shake-up the margins of the larger firms, the pilots are all they get before the brand exits.

A way around this is to have an inventory of about $50,000,000 in thousands of screens somehow deployed everywhere and then just coast on some magic money while you hopefully spin up enough tech to combat the fundamental issues and be attractive to the established players.

Or, you could look for new markets.  DOOH is an innovator's and early adopter's playground which are the foundations of the emerg*ent* market. There is a separate value system that they have which are unique:

 * hyper localized - it's the only advertisement that drifts down side streets as a matter of course
 * low entry cost - usually a CLTV that doesn't make a sales team or any middleman (who are in it to take some icing off the margins) make sense
 * a place to experiment - different ads can be played to different parts of town 
 * a longer timeline of execution - since vehicles aren't necessarily guaranteed in any location, a campaign lasting weeks or even months at an affordable rate can lead to a decent MRR (monthly recuring revenue) ROI (return on investment).

This is fundamentally a substantively different kind of customer. It becomes a low maintenance, low cost, low touch, low expectation product similar to any social media account.  It's ideal for small businesses such as private tutors or a local restaurant, for small events or things like a yard sale, lost dog, anything that can placed on a bulletin board.  It's a NextDoor for advertising. That's the product/market fit (see The four steps to epiphany).

Accuracy of reporting, low audience attention, inability to do psychographic targeting, none of these matter. And because we aren't on an Ad network, which is part of an exchange interfaced through DSPs we don't need to hit the kind of CPM provability targets because we don't have to sell using the CPM metric. The base unit commodity can now be whatever we want.

Also this will be advertisement that consumers will want more than some branding strategy from a large firm, the wonkiness of acronyms is gone, and importantly, we built a platform to make creation of the ad have the same level of difficulty as a facebook or twitter post.

So that means a person can spend $10/month, take a minute or two to do it, and then get whatever serviceable metrics we can honestly give. And if it doesn't reach their goals, then it's such a small investment it doesn't matter - like a custom printed coffee cup that doesn't come out right - people will generally either be happy with it, order another one or simply move on with life - white glove treatment and large customer acquisition costs don't need to take place.

Well at least, that's the plan. This has been the result of about 18 months of active research and conversation to figure out how to do this well. 

The overall goal here is to make this product be a manifestation of a soul of tomorrow - a different way of interacting with the world and be suggestive of a future that recaptures the social space for the social demos, redefining outdoor advertising from a one-way top-down broadcast medium to a local community building exercise resurfacing the world that collapsed with the exodus of local newspapers and weeklies.

We lost something which hasn't been recaptured by the public. Every attempt, such as craigslist or nextdoor face the same problem - not everyone is on it, not everyone engages with it, not everyone uses it.  There was a time, in living memory of most people whereby simply printing something in a local newspaper was sufficient to assume effectively everyone saw it.

That communal experience among strangers which is the twine that binds them as a community has loosened and frayed.  Screens on top of cars may not, in fact, probably won't, amend this. But that's not goal, it's a proposal for the future, as the classic X-Minus 1 radio show put it:

> These are stories of the future; adventures in which you'll live in a million could-be years on a thousand may-be worlds.

Visionaries come from everywhere, visions can be anything. When created with the right value of being, experiences are fundamentally transformative and magic happens.

We have a conference room where I put on the magic act where I construct the future of this soul of tomorrow for all that have listened. I honestly don't expect to hit the mark on the 1.0 version (live in 25 days). What I hope to do, instead, is have a structure that facilitates a learning experience and conversation. 

Much like modern art, we are building a thing which intends to be the start of a conversation with enough vagueness of coherency and direction to find a market so that they'll reach out and grab us.  What we are creating is a disconnection from the existing framework and an extension of the thoughts of another group, constituting the market segment.

It's flexible enough to be collective, individual, and sharable but elusive enough that it's not inherently exlclusionary. 

All companies and creators need to pivot after a release of anything in the world, from the role of speaker to that of listener. The time of release is the transition of roles.

It's not a listener of the existing customer or the existing market. It's a listening for the possibility of a could be market and a would be customer and how to share a collective future vision that is constructed together.

This is how the S-Curve effect (see Zero-to-one, Innovator's Dilemma) can be overcome. The S-Curve, the fact that there's two asymptotes of advancement at the beginning and the end of a technology, is a natural consequence of the geometry of being.

The definition of the thing sits inside this geometry of being and is confined by it so the extracted value follows, effectively a peak-oil graph.  The S-curve is defeated by having a permeable geometry of being.
