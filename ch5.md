## Technology: the first 5,000 years

The biggest insight to help understand technology is first to understand property in the context of gift economies. 

A gift economy has a different definition of property than what we are accustomed to. In property law, the term "alienable" means the ability of property to be completely owned and transferred, usually through buying and selling, ie, private property.  

In gift economies, this assumption is up for grabs, the original "owner" can define and have use-rights and may eventually request it returned.

This leads to the insight that property isn't a thing, it's a relationship among people about things. The human relationship and social arrangement has primacy and the object is a vehicle for it.  Property is a set of conventions practiced with physical objects. In more traditional economies, there can be restrictions through copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Thus the notion of property is fundamentally a relationship. What can and cannot be property and the rights one can do on their property is also a function of relationships. 

Moving on to technology, technology is a mechanism of relationships among people and their environment.  It's a physical or fictional (in the legal sense) device that has a describable mechanical nature. Technology may or may not involve a physical object but *it is not the object itself*. In the same way that property is the relationship, technology is a mechanism.

To illustrate this, let's use a microscope. The microscope isn't The technology, it's just a part of it. Event if it's just one person using it, making an observation, there's still a fundamental relationship, that's the technology. The root word, relate, the parameters of interaction and knowledge, that's the core permutation of science made by the processes of things such as observations. 

The microscope was key in understanding diseases and how humans related with the diseases. The microscope is a device of environmental relationship. 

Marx called this mistaking of the relationship (among people) for the physical object "commodity fetishism", or in our case, the economic relationship among physical objects obscures the true nature of technology. If we fetishize the physical object of the microscope and assume it *is* the technology, it misdirects our intentions away from our goals in using the physical object.

Laws, language, arithmetic, these are also technologies. If you've ever read mathematical text without proper training you've probably found it confusing. Mathematics has a technical, or technological way of dealing with words, a specific and rigid philosophy of meaning, a contoured geometry of specificity. It can't be dealt with without such stringency.

When these things are viewed as the process and systems of skills, crafts, art and techniques it allows us to see tekne-logy in the way we organize our institutions, govern our relationships, and also, of course, in the physical objects of our use.  But more importantly, our use of it is part of the technology and a separate and distinct form of technology.

There's three groups of technology: people (ex: skills, crafts, abilities), process (ex: relationships, responsibilities, institutions), and physical objects (ex: computers, tools, airplanes). These can be orchestrated towards a goal if they are the right kinds of people, processes, and physical objects capable of collectively reaching that end together.

"People" refers their craft and method. "Process" refers to the rules governing their relationship with others and physical objects are the tools of execution.

When someone says "it's a people problem" or "people problems can't be fixed with technology" what they mean is that the methods and crafts do not necessarily depend on physical objects.  The same paintbrush in different hands can yield dramatically different results.  Trying to orient the results by redesigning the paintbrush is far less effective then just finding the right person to hand the brush to.

This is the interplay of technology.  A complete technology execution has all 3 of these and gets to the value of being.

For example, the Catholic Church has people, processes, and physical objects that are orchestrated together and as a result is a continuous technology dating, as an institution, at least 1500 years. Because they are all tightly and intimately connected, the institution of the church tries to exist as its own thing, disconnected from reality except through certain levers and mechanisms, in the same way that a machine is defined by the finite number of operations that can be done upon it.

The US Constitution, as a document, is another piece of technology - originally defining people, processes, and the relationship of physical objects, called property. 

### What is the future?

If the future is a place with "better" technology, what does that mean, given the idea that technology is such a broad categorization? Does it mean more cleanly achieving the lower-level goals or a different manifestation in service of higher level goals?

And if so, in what service to those higher level goals? Greater value crafts, processes, and objects? What should a futurist set out to do? What is a future worth building?

Every future is a construction of the past. An output of work done by past selves and past thoughts. The parameters of future technology can only be defined by present goals. A "breakthrough" technology is always accompanied by a break in the continuity of a set of goals.  Conversely, a *Voluntary* break in the continuity of a set of goals is an effective method towards breakthrough technologies.

As opposed to being a linear projection of current metrics ($/gb, miles/kwh), the future is instead, inherently about redirection because it requires a break in continuity, a redefinition of goals, a re-imagining of interaction between these 3 pillars of technology.

This is how things have played out. In the 1920s, movies and books thought we'd have massively tall buildings in compact cities - instead, in the 1940s suburbia was invented and cities expanded horizontally.

Instead of massive computers we'd be instructing to run our lives, we have tiny pocket computers that are more often instructing us.

The depictions in the 1950s of centuries in the future had rockets zipping around space, but it was still a future composed of white men making decisions while their wives, in completely unmodified traditional heterosexual marriage arrangements, were slaving away in the future kitchens or doing some other dotty activity.

The essence of future is a deviation and disruption in process, craft, or tool in a realignment towards a new set of goals. This is the process of technology.

For instance, the Athenian Solonian Constitution, in the early 6th century BC abolished all debts, freed all debt-based slaveries, abolished an early form of serfdom, got rid of hereditary political offices, and created a bicameral legislature. That's technology, that's a vision for a new future.

### Anti-technology is also about building futures

With the expanded framework of technology, we can see that anti-technology is instead of a return to the past, the baseline requirements to boldly redirect how no man has redirected before and orient the 3 sets of techology around a different locus of goals.

Neo-luddism, in its present form is an advocacy for a different set of devices, a different mechanism of relationship with each other and the environment.

In 1990, Chellis Glendinning published "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto" arguing in favor of a search for new technological forms that are local in scale and promote social (people) and political (process) freedom.

Ted Kaczynski, in his Unabomber manifesto said a similar thing, calling for "new values that will free them from the yoke of the present technoindustrial system". He goes on to talk about a reverence to nature, rejection of civilization, and a change in the relationship among material goods which no longer values their acquisition (because of the rejection of the relationship of private property).

Most analysis the first luddite movement, the famous secret society that destroyed machines, claims it was craftsmen in fear of losing their jobs. Let's apply our analysis of technology and look deeper.

Its namesake is after a man who may or may not have existed, Ned Ludd, who by the time the namesake of Luddite, had been adopted, had been developed into a robin hood like character.  Magistrates, merchants, and proto-industrialists received death threats and were attacked. The machines were destroyed possibly because they represented great investments and a conveniently exposed target.

It was part of the long arc of labor struggle in the 19th century.  Labor being the people, process, and tools - the act of technology. The struggle is once again, about trying to redirect the goals and establish new ones.

This act of destroying and disrupting current systems in the namesake of new ones is inherently a future oriented act. 

When viewed in this lens, it is the close cousin of another British movement in the exact same era called the "March of Intellect".

The tools of the industrial revolution reoriented the goals of people and processes leading to an increase in literacy along with printed literature and education. The price of education and the price of literature became attainable to a much larger segment of the population.

Along with that there were new institutions such as coffee houses (as opposed to bars) and mechanics institutes (organization trying to change society by disseminating scientific thinking and research into engineering solutions), and literary and philosophy societies.

The societal, social, and political implications of this technology along with the potential power disruption wasn't lost on the people of the time. Some (such as the Liberal Whigs) advocated for only disseminating "useful" information with the operative "useful" being a fluid, debated term.  There was other concerns that over-education, as in a training of new processes to guide relationships, would lead to a reduction in moral fibre and social unrest, leading to a disruptive innovation in the technology of government (which eventually happened in 1848).

The core hypothesis of the March of Intellect in the context of the Industrial Revolution was that the effects of a technological upheavel, such as a new machine, could have a contagion effect towards the other forms of technology, such as religion, government, and the social arrangements and relationships surrounding capital and labor.  

The critics and advocates of both movements (Luddites and March of Intellect) made the same admittance by the nature of their actions: The power dynamic that guides the direction and flow of these mechanisms of relationships known as technology has a logical arrangement that is an artifact of circumstances in history which was at risk of being obsoleted and supplanted. The potential is that any column (people, process, tools) of technology in its act of goal redirection can lead to a disconnection from the structure of this past and ultimately lay a foundation for a form of liberation and power rearrangement in the future.

The deep interconnectedness of the three pieces inherent ability to affect each other either  intentionally or merely consequentially was obvious to the Luddites, political parties and other social movements in 19th century British society. The Industrial Revolution was fundamentally discontinuous: one of people, process, *and* tools. This meant that for a while, the new power relationships that these dynamics implicated were not only completely undefined but also, due to its disruptive nature, fundamentally undefinable.

This is the nature of connection between the modern Neoluddites and a fundamental anarchism: it's not a return to the past, it's a liberation from it.

Understanding how this system of disruption, death, and rebirth happens is the key to understanding the potential and interplay between technology and future. In the following chapters we'll go more into the principles which guide processes to define a future worth building.
