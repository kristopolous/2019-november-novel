## Technology: the first 5,000 years

The biggest insight to help understand technology is first to understand property in the context of gift economies.

Property isn't a thing, in this analysis, it's a relationship among people about things. The insight is the human relationship and social arrangement has primacy. The property is a convention practiced about an object.

Technology isn't a thing in this sense, it's a device, a mechanism of relationships with each other and the environment.

Let's take a microscope as a skeptical example. It's just one person using it, making an observation, where's the relationship? The root word, relate, the parameters of interaction and knowledge, that's the core permutation of science made by the processes of things such as observations 

The microscope was key in understanding diseases and how humans related with the diseases. The microscope is a device of environmental relationship.

Laws, language, arithmetic, these are also technologies. If you've ever read mathematical text without proper training you've probably found it confusing. Mathematics has a technical, or technological way of dealing with words, a specific and rigid philosophy of meaning, a contoured geometry of specificity. It can't be dealt with without such stringency.

What is technology? What is the future, why does it matter?
How does technology, made by past selves, comprising ghosts of history, build future
The class or technology must be matched with the class of problem
What did anti technology mean
