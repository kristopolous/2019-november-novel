2.4 Newspapers and the great upheaval
-----------------------------------
Whole communication technology have the implication of the TPP model in its own unique way.

By now it should be expected that the future is about a reordering of structure and redefinition of terms, someone who takes society's coloring book and draws an entirely new thing on the page instead.

For communication, this manifested as a paradigmatic pattern, which I'll call the "communication wave", that was repeated 5 times:

1. A new communication tool is invented
2. Commercialization on it is initially forbidden or nascent
3. It is seen as a March of Intellect with the ability to upend old structures and enlighten the masses
4. Commercialization and a gold rush commences
5. The technology upends previously unacknowledged structures and creates new ones
6. New power potential is made, undefined at first, then eventually filled as goals and power structures are redefined or reorchestrated
7. Usually subsequent, smaller scale imitation wavex happens decades later as the *economic reproduction* [#]_ becomes democratized

The 5 technologies

1. Print media
2. Radio
3. Television
4. Cell phones
5. Online services and the internet

These all developed along similar patterns with similar processes and similar results. Furthermore, these patterns can usually be fractally applied to each of the subdivision of steps.

We'll start with a tool that has mostly dissappeared from the landscape: the common newspaper.

The future shaping impact of the newspaper was only possible in a society of literate people. These people had to have acquired the skills to read, the process of the newsroom and organizational structure of gathering news had to exist, and the tools of both electronic wire communication, mechanical type-casting machine, and cheap on the fly mass production had to exist. If any one of these didn't work, the potential of future shaping in the system as a whole wouldn't have.

Newspapers, defined as a periodic, universal, publicly accessible, and current (as opposed to say, the kind of historical analysis this book offers) had been around, without dispute since at least 1605. [#]_ By the 1660s, newspapers were available in France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and to German and Italian speakers. Provided mostly at-cost or at small profit, publications were viewed as a public service as a more reliable way to get information.

But the mere existence of tool of newspaper wasn't enough. It wasn't until nearly 200 years later, in the 1810s, that the tool of the printing presses, capable of making over 1,000 impressions per hour (albiet typeset by hand), on both sides of the newsprint material (at this time, cotton paper, also known as cotton rags), existed.

In the 1830s, a new innovation, relying on commercialization through advertising as opposed to a mostly at-cost subscription model, and a steam-powered as opposed to a hand-powered press, led to the introduction of a "penny press". [#]_  This along with the massive reduction in the price of a paper, process, and printing tools gave way to an explosion of cheap periodicals, costing 1/6th the price of the other offerings.

The penny press captured a new emerging market, due to being 83% less costly, and covered different material than what was targeted towards the upper class such as sports, crime news, and gossip. Their variations today would be closest to tabloids. New technology often finds a home in the forgiving world of novelty and recreation as the PPT is garnering increasing reliability. 

By the 1840s, wood pulp pressing was developed in the 1840s to further reduce costs and increase the size of newspapers, this meant by then there was:

- People skills: public literacy and a skill of sensationalist writing towards a mass audience 
- Process: a financial model based on advertising, simple language, and daily publications
- Tools: mass print machines, photography, railroads, and the telegraph

This groundwork of people, process, and tool technology should now be in place for a realignment of goals, a disruption of process, and a new dynamic to emerge. Furthermore, these technological columns, some in the works for 200 years, would not have been able to have affected things without the interplay of the other two.  When these things come together, the reach distance of futures narrow to achievability.

In 1843, a Parisian newspaper named *La Réforme* started publication. Some of the regular contributors included Karl Marx (who later became the editor of his own paper, *Neue Rheinische Zeitung* in 1848), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first person to call himself an anarchist, and a journalist at three other newspapers, and Mikhail Bakunin, regarded as one of the most important anarchists in the 19th century.  Their writings in this newspapre was the primary vehicle that set them into their fame. The job of journalist was early on in all of their careers.

Their writings in *La Réforme*, are credited with instrumenting the 1848 French Revolution and many similar copycat revolutions throughout Europe. In this context we have to consider people like Karl Marx, not as a revolutionary thinker that everyone knows, but as just a journalist writing for a Paris paper.

After the success of the 1848 French Revolution, the editors, writers, and journalists of *La Réforme* were given politcal power and made part of the provisional French government. [#]_ The disruptive technologists in a disrupted society were put in charge of controlling it at the urgings of the public. 

These publics had assumed the future as depicted by these journalists using these technologies could be administered by them.  This wasn't the last time such a projection of assumption of ability was made of the technological opportunists of the era. 

As Reid Hoffman explains in Blitzscaling, the skills to create a future, the skills to administrate a future, and the skills to control a future, are different stages of an innovation cycle and most likely, the jobs of different people.

Furthermore, when this conscious transformation isn't done, then the earlier act that led to the revolution is the thing that continues getting done but at a more massive scale by more participants. Trotsky's permanent revolution without a counterbalance means never making the transition to control and administration.

In our 1848 Paris example, even though 54% of the businesses had left the cities, 479 newspapers were founded, many not in the French language.  This undefinable power vacuum, in the midst of the second revolution happened because the paper made the news events. Now the news events made the papers.

Papers with news from Paris were stocked on the newly constructed inter-city European trains which would take 2-3 days to go to other cities where people would line up and buy them in a frenzy. Those lucky enough to get a copy would often do things like stand on tables at coffee houses, reading it aloud to the others in the room.

That is future, that is technology. That is tomorrow.

   The news from Paris became the primary business of Paris, as hundreds of small papers prepare publications for the trains in the middle of the night, from L'Illustration, Journal Universel, 1848.

As the media companies that came after it, the newspaper, in this time, was poised to become the Silicon Valley of its era due to the interaction of the three columns of techology.

Cutting-edge tools and processes allowed for photographs to be included in newspapers through various engraving techniques, effectively tracing a photograph onto an engraving plate.  The first photograph to be used in a paper was of war barricades out of Paris in 1848, taken June 25, 1848, "Barricades rue Saint-Maur. Avant l'attaque" and included in L'Illustration in July of that year.

Five years later, by the time the Crimean War broke out, photojournalism, telegraphy, cheap wood pulp printing, a literate public, and transport by trains, had come together.

Publications such as The London Illustrated News, prominantly featured daguerreotyphic engravings, often multiple ones on each page documenting the war. Capturing compelling photographs were so important for the sale of the paper that sometimes they may have been staged. Researchers have uncovered, for instance, a second version of Roger Fenton's "Valley of the Shadow of Death", which features numerous canonballs on a roadside, with far fewer canonballs.  Apparently, in order to create a more sensationalist photograph, canonballs might have been transferred into the frame in order to assist the narrative.

As discussed in 1.3, it was Fenton's audacity, absurdity, intention, and coherency that led to the quality of the photograph, being the most famous and celebrated photojournalism example of the 19th century. Also as discussed, authenticity, accuracy, and reality are decidedly not part of the mix - in fact, they arguably play no role at all (see the discussion on Mayer Rothschild below).

At the beginning of the war, in 1853, it took about 4 days for news to reach London. In 1854, a new telegraph to the French coast reduced it to 2 days and the following year, an undersea cable reduced it to a few hours.  

This is a 25-fold speed increase in 2 years. Like the 2nd French Revolution, the Crimean War became a significant news event.  For London, so much so, that it led to the ascension of one of the british commanders, Viscount Palmerston, to the cabinet of Prime Minister.

The tech boom was underway and reality was being redefined.

As the century went on, large newspaper empires formed and some of the wealthiest people of the 19th century came to their riches from the newspaper or the manipulation of it.

The power of the press was so captured by the imagination of the people of the time, that even ficticious stories were passed around to attribute an accumulation of wealth.  For example, in 1846, a French pamphlet made a false claim that Nathan Mayer Rothschild had early access to war news, falsely reported it, sending the market into freefall, then swooped up ownership of the shares before it was corrected, making significant profit.  However, there's no public record of such large volume trading that day, a market crash and rebound or of false, then true news being reported.  The material evidence is not there.  The frenzy of the potential of newspaper technology to be the tool that constructs the future, however, so captured the imagination, that it did not matter.  The apocryphal narrative caught on and is still repeated as if it actually happened to this day.  Audaction, absurd, intentioned, and coherent, but ultimately completely untrue.  

Apparently, reality doesn't actually effect the quality of an idea. Since we are in the pursuit of constructing futures, this allows us to detach ourselves from the constraints of reality at will. A strong transmission of the imaginary doesn't change the objective truths of the pastr. Its objective, as we recall, is to make the facts of the past not actually relevant to the outcomes of the future.

The people who actually did make their millions in newspapers, in the US, occupied a part of manahatten known as Park Row.
It was home to some of the earliest examples of skyscrapers. In the same way that people today speak of the flashy wealth and future orientation of the tech giants, at the late 19th century, the same thing was said about the newspaper giants.

   This photograph, taken around 1900, shows, what at the time were some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. In order, the Pulitzer New York World (newspaper) building, New Yorker Staats-Zeitung (the leading German newspaper) building, New York Tribune building, and the New York Times building.

Following the S-Curve models, as technologies become mature, margin on production become thinner forcing future innovation to a reduction of cost in the tools of construction.  This decrease in production cost eventually collapses the power of the gatekeepers as they existed primarily because of the barriers of production implicated producers being selected through a process of kingmaking.

Expanding reach inherently leads to specialization and the silo effect from that specialization. This can cause a disunification of the consumer base into tribes

Although fitting historical narratives into a framework of rational actors motivated by individualistic financial incentives is rather unrealistic (it requires humans to be shrewd sociopaths who callously disregard the whole of society as if we're all truly ghoulish villains [#]_ ), it is sometimes appropriate.

For the process of newspapers and print this took two paths: 

  * specialized hot metal type-setting machines (via the side-channel of the telegraph and typewriter) for mechanically laying out a press 

  * the rise of photography based duplication machines, through technologies such as spirit duplicating, photostat and xerography (electrostat)

This disunification effect led to a split of journalism politics in the early 1900s along controversies of the era, such as unionization and the suffragist movement. As the organizational capacity required to produce decrease, the number of producing organizations increased. For instance, in the 1880s, there were womens suffragist periodicals such as The Woman's Journal and The Woman Suffrage Leaflet. By 1918 however, costs had reduced so that even anti-feminist anti-suffragist women's leagues (however small in number) could publish their own journal, in this case named "The Woman Patriot".

In the 1930s, "zines" containing fiction stories that were produced using spirit duplicating "ditto machines" permitted publications with circulation even in the hundreds to be feasible. At first they were novelty fictions, similar to what were called "dime store novels". Some of the later greats of science fiction, such as Isaac Asimov, got their start writing stories for such spirit duplicated zines.

The mass democratization made possible by these duplication machines as printing presses played significant roles in social movements of the era.  Because the publications were sustainable on such low circulation numbers. For instance, ONE magazine, a gay-themed periodical advocating for things such as gay marriage and equal rights, was able to start publishing in 1952, 17 years before the stonewall riots. This was followed, using the same physical Los Angeles Xerox machine, 3 years later by the Mattachine Society (founded 1950), starting up their own gay rights publication, the Mattachine Review.  

The photocopier at this time was used like a timeshare computer.  Clusters of related organizations pooled together resources, and paid for a single machine (which cost about $300,000 in 2019 dollars) and then put it to work day and night on time-schedules for different publications.

Over time, the photocopier as a printing press for the masses became increasingly practical. Machines such as the Xerox 914 could be rented monthly at 0.3% the cost of buying it outright (about $775/month in 2019 dollars). This meant it could be commercially rented and made available to the public in a timeshare system (like a copy shop or one machine responsible for multiple publications).

In the same way that La Reforme in the 1840s led to the 2nd French Revolution, and the smaller suffragist publications led to the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920, the increasing number of black-owned zines made geographically diluted civil rights organization possible and gave rise to a collective identity for other marginalized minority communities.

By the 1980s, this process was seen as so central that NGOs sent Xerox machines to groups doing 3rd world liberation struggles in various countries. In the 1980s the Open Society sent machines to the Eastern Block of the Soviet Empire to undermine the Moscow hegemony.

This is how revolution happened. This is how technology happens and this is what future is.  But we have more ways of communicating then words on a page.

.. [#] Economic reproduction is a technical term from Marxist Economics covering the entire product lifecycle of production, distribution, circulation, and consumption. A democratization of this structure means that any party can participate at any step unencumbered by restricted access due to things such as price and access barriers.

.. [#] There's many things that makes humans human. The most striking however, is we are the most social, least individualistic species to ever exist. We are the only one with things such as institutions and complex languages. Everything we do is drenched with socializing and collectivizing. When we eat, for instance, we use recipes, communicated methods of food preparations. The food we eat is not individually captured by us but came through massively collaborated collective acts. Every inch of being human is about interaction and extrinsic values, not individual gain. The notion that we are all truly greedy individuals is in direct conflict with the very essence of what makes humans human.
