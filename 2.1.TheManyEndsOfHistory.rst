1 The many ends of history
--------------------------

Perhaps the only thing more inaccurate than a description of a future world is a declaration of its absence.

The inability to participate in either an evolutionary or revolutionary imaginary of the present rests fundamentally on the idea that the world right now is at or near the final stage of existence.  This manifests itself in either one of two ways:

  * There will exist a nearly infinite perpetuation of the present dynamics (steady state theory)
    
  * We are on the precipous of a major moment of retrograde (collapse theory)

These exist as frequently as an origin or after-life narrative because of the fundamental insight into what technology is as outlined in 1.1
