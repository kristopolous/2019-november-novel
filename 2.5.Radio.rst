2.5 Radio, television, and the internet
---------------------------------------

The narrative dynamics of the technology of newspapers and their cultural and societal impacts in the 19th century worked off mechanics that instrumented themselves multiple times on each successive medium of the 20th century.

The transitional technologies [#]_ which moved the theater of narrative from the written page to the pocket video player followed the same communication wave as newspapers as the new stepwise plateaus became available via their PPT requirements.

Each successive tool (except for one), from introduction had an

- increased potential reach of the message 
   
- increased speed of transmission

- decreased labor and capital to prouce 

- decreased time to deployment

Possible horizons are both constrained by the action and the imaginary and the material realities and their power dynamics of control surrounding them.  Some punditry claims that solely individual attitude and action can change society and some punditry says that it's the structure of ownership and power with individual action an illusion.

Hopefully the historical analysis up to this point has shown how both a structuring of possibility and a structuring of action are needed before the trajectories diverge to constitute future steps.

2.5.1 Radio: Walls no longer matter
===================================

The next technology we are going to look at is Hertzian waves, so named after experimental physicist Heinrich Hertz. By the early 1900s, the technology of wave transmission was suggested for Wireless Telegraphs and Wireless Telephones.  It was used by ships to send messages at sea.  The separation of the frequency spectrem into channels and the commercialization of these "radio" devices was done by the Italian businessman Guglielmo Marconi who was the first to see the business potential of long-distance radio and is often credited with the invention of modern radio.

"Invention" was dealt with in 2.3

In the 1910s radio transmitters and receivers came in kits and became a hobby of tinkerers, much like the first microcomputers in the 1970s. The crystal radio receiver was attractive because it didn't require external power. These "amateur radio license" were at the time just "radio license". In 1917 there were 13,581 licenses for people to transmit radio but at the time it was mostly just telegraph signals and grainy voice (the boom for recorded music was still 10 years off).

By 1919, Frank Conrad, who worked for Westinghouse started broadcasting music and it led to Westinghouse starting a radio station.  Newspapers followed, starting their own local stations. It created a boom in the purchase of radios, which Westinghouse was more than happy to manufacture.

Part of what enabled the growth of radio in the 1920s was the complicated formation of the Radio Corporation of America. Essentially, there was a desire for the British Marconi corporation to be split off and incorporated in the US. Then there were a number of patents that needed to be leveraged to get to a whole product. This led to RCA, in 1921 being controlled by GE, Westinghouse, AT&T, and United Fruit company, essentially establishing a separate entity to focus on radio technology (following Christensen's model)

In the same way that newspapers were only useful if people could read them, radio broadcasts were only meaningful if people could receive them.

2.5.2 Television: Communication through illusion
================================================

Similar to the previous technologies, television had a long experimentation phase, first starting as wired transmissions to completely mechanical devices and then during the radio craze switching to wireless transmissions.  The mechanical technology had a number of fundamental limits on how big the picture could be and how smooth the video could be.  Despite this, the first television station started in 1928.  We now have a two sided marketplace, a producer and device to consume.

The cathode ray tube, a much more promising mechanism than the mechanical wheel, was being perfected by independent groups around the world in the 1920s. By the late 1920s, press demonstrations were being given.  Throughout the 1930s, television cameras (which were a different technology from film cameras) were being developed to increase the light sensitivity and half-tone quality of the picture.

Successfully receiving television, unlike with radio, required a number of arbitrary parameters to be agreed upon (how many scanlines for a picture, what the refresh rate was, what the direction and orientation of the picture should be, etc). This led to a fractured market. So that NBC, which was created again, by RCA, could be recieved by RCA televisions. It was even more divided than that. Philadelphia NBC and New York NBC used separate technologies which meant separate devices between the two markets. Having competing standads doesn't work out for a consumer who just wants one device for all stations.

As a result nationwide standards started developing standards, with the world split into NTSC, PAL, and SECAM, 3 different standards for television broadcasting and reception, dividied among nations (which have since switched to digital standards, divided up differently among countries, as DTMB, ISDB, and DVB).

2.5.3 Internet: As we may dream
===============================

The Internet came out of the same trajectory as telephones and telegraphs (which this text is not covering). The earliest devices were self contained under single administrative bodies (owners). The initial telephones, for instance, were shared lines over say, a large farm. This was of limited utility when one person wanted to communicate with say, their neighbor. The notion of an indirect, on-demand "switching" network started in the 1870s.

Initially, computers operated like the first telephones. There were terminals, even remote ones, to a single computer. Fully automated mechanical telephone switching had been around since the 1880 and by the 1950s, completely relay controlled number 5 crossbar switching systems allowed for a fully automated national phone network. They were, however, completely mechanical (with relay memory and punchcard routing and debugging). 

The idea of making a switching network for computers was an obvious step. However, much like for television, there initially wasn't any agreement on how to do this. The ARPANET, often cited as the forerunner to the internet had a number of competing, incompatible standards at the time: NPL network, X.25, Merit Network, CYCLADES, and Telenet.

It's important to note the creation of the ARPANET was not a defense against nuclear war as many say.  It was instead a way for researchers could gain acccess to work done at other laboratories or as Dr. J. C. R. Licklider, one of the founders of the internet said, in 1972, "The necessity was to transfer what was learned one place effectively to other places without redoing it all. The computers were capable of doing this, the [people/process] communications was inadequate." Linklider, when discussing the design of what eventually became ARPANET absurdly called it the "Intergalactic Computer Network" in his initial memorandom calling for a need of the network. In the document he went into detail talking about how different teams using different computers had work that could be used together but there was no agreed upon way of interconnecting things so that one person could use any machine.

The internet as a distribution  solution. 
Send at the point of consumption.

It's gotta include more than just the technology of getting computer A to talk to Computer B, it's gotta include the human institutions that will bring together these resources and people to solve real problems of real people.
Rihard W. Watson (25:10)


The linguistic transformation from "Internet" as a tool to "The Internet" as a whole technology happened around 1994. This was not so much a cultural shift in understanding but a changed appropriation of use.

Sending an email over "internet" sounded as logical as sending an email over "aol" or "compuserve" (other online networks of the time). Generally we put "the" in front of words when we consider it a peerless class, it's an exalted state wherein we implicitly claim either non-ambiguity or non-equivalence with others. For instance, you can get "a cold" but you get "the flu". This classification is the expanding of the possible as all encompassing around a specific instance and as the instance to be an unambigous representative of the class.  

The Internet, as in the networked highway of machines, is not the same thing as the web, technically a set of protocols, but for our purposes, a network highway of thought; well that was the idea of the web anyway.  

The web was talked about in AICA terms for about 40 years before it arguably first happened for real as TBL's WWW. The first mass exposure to some mechanically instrumented library of all knowledge using completely fanciful interfaces was by an extremely well respected Engineer who worked on the Manhatten Project and started Raythen and the National Science Foudnation, Vannevar Bush. He described a Roald Dahl style machine called the Memex in a 1945 article for the Atlantic Monthly called "As We May Think". This was followed and built upon by other philosophers and thinkers such as Ted Nelson who coined the term hypertext in 1963. A number of early systems were built by people such as Douglas Engelbart in 1968 and the hypercard system in 1987.

   We can see two languishing points in the logarithmic growth of internet hosts both getting unpinned by a change in organizational processes. Tools alone could not unpin these ceilings. Once again, systems have limits independent of the physical limitations of the tools. All 3 technologies must move forward together.

The internet disrupts consumer by consumer and product by product, not industry by industry.

2.5.4 Smart Phones: The truly personal computer
===============================================

The concept of a cell phone was initially implemented as radio phones. As we discussed with early phone technology in the internet section and early radio technology, the distinction between two-way radio and mobile telephony was rather indistinguishable at first. In the 1940s there were centralized towers and phones weighing quite a bit to connect to them (this period is retroactively referred to as 0G).  Over the next 70 years lots of things happened including the rise of cell phones and introduction of text messaging but we're going to actually skip all of that until the smart phone.  The smart phone completed the personalized 2nd wave of the internet. No longer were you calling a place, you were calling a person. No longer were there shared computers by proximity, now the computer followed the individual and were truly personal for the first time.

The one-device-to-rule-them-all had been in the popular mind since at least the 1980s with the rise of the PDA. Companies like HP, Psion, RIM, and Palm provided a vision of a device being a communication singularity. The notion of it as a singular communication point goes back to the 1970s under a work called the dynabook. Initially invisioned as a modern netbook during a time when nobody even had a computer at home, the inventor of this absurd device, XXX.  There were many early ventures into these devices. IBM had the XXX, Apple had the Newton, ...

The science arguably wasn't where it needed to be to fill the dream but arguably more important was the network wasn't. Predecessor to 802.11 (simply called WiFi) existed but there were many standards and very little ubiquity.  There were cellular modems and even ones with RJ-11 jacks (phone jacks) to do 28.8 kb/s dialup speeds so you'd temporarily go online at either great inconvenience or great cost, slowly check a few things, then quickly disconnect.

Notes
*****

.. [#] Some authors separate continuous versus discontinuous innovation. Moore (Crossing the Chasm) and Christensen (Innovator's Dilemma) describe how different mechanics are in play for two classes of product introductions.  This ultimately is a producer-side analysis.  Consumer-side discontinuity is not always in tandem with producer side. For instance, non-technical consumers likely have zero realization of the transition from mechanical magnetic platter-based storage to solid state chip based storage even though this is the most significant leap in computer storage since the first hard drive shipped in 1956. For the world writ large, there needs to be discontinuity in the "90" part of the 1-9-90 rule for a perceptual discontinuity outside the "inside baseball" of the industry. Even then, there isn't a single dimension of appraisal. Some dimensions have continuity while others have breaks and redirections. The lynchpins of continuous dimensions are the core function of coherency in the AICA model.
