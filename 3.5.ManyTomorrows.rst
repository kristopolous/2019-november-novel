5 The many worlds of tomorrow
-----------------------------

On my bookshelf I have a number of futurist works I collected from writing this manuscript. 
As a culture we have lost our hope in the future. The magnificent visions of the future that populated the bookshelves since
about 1860 have turned dark and hopeless. It has become far easier to imagine a future of smouldering ruin then of a wonderous future.

In 1983, Omni magazine published a future almanac, comitting 300 pages to concrete future predictions.

By 2020, we were *supposed* to have 2,000 people living in space, fusion reactors, asteroid mining, and be in anticipation of a new ice age. Also in this book the Soviet Union still exists.

Also notable firsts that did happen, such as the first black president, expansion of gay rights, that most reading would happen over computer screens instead of books, this missed them

Trajectories, even discontinuous ones, are always easier to predict as the future when compared to the self-referential adaptive mechanisms that actually permute the present and present it as the future.

Because they have a chaotic dynamic (there's a sensitivity to initial conditions, there's a deep amount of mixing and a periodic power assymetry), futures are achievable as a metric of their "distance" from the present.  

This distance is the challenge. As Lenin, from the Soviet Union said, "There are decades when nothing happens; and there are weeks when decades happen." or to use the title of a book by Alexei Yurchak about the final years of the Soviet Union "Everything was forever until it was no more".

The Soviet collapse was both obvious and unexpected.  Like a friend who trades stock once told me "The market is going to crash some day soon, but probably not tomorrow."

Even though there is a fundamental dynamic of the system that makes it inpenetrable it's the same one that makes it coherently predictable.  This same friend tells me he can draw the future price of any stock on a graph so long as he isn't required to label the axis. The timing of the inevitable is part of the initial condition to the subsequent permutation of the future and determines the affordances to opportunities.

Preparation is for that which cannot be controlled. Adaptation is for that which cannot be prepared. Death is for that which cannot be adapted.

This book has about taking the potential of future-thought, grabbing it by the horns, and riding it. The closing section is about recognizing that the future is always happening upon us and unless we can calibrate our thoughts to the new initial conditions, we will not have the means of persuading the trajectory.
