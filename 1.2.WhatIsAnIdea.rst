What is an Idea?

## Make tomorrow worth waiting for
Hopes and dreams can have a crippling effect.

The more I expect from something, the less I can take action on it.  The less I expect, the better I do. But the lack of expectations can't be merely theatrical - I have to genuinely believe nothing is going to happen for things to happen. Imagination only moves when I commit to dismissing reality.  That's a required act to permit a new reality to be imagined, believed in, and acted upon. Only through a sincere commitment to fiction can the future be made.

I can fake things for others but only when I fake things for myself as well do things truly change.

It's November 1st, 2019, nearly 4 years into a startup that arguably never really started up. This would be ok if we were a bunch of 22 year olds, on our first go, and that modifier after 4 was "months" but instead I am 37 and have been doing this for 20 years.

Can someone do well, pay all their bills, have a decent savings growing, and still be a complete an utter failure at life?

Amorphous words like "success" unmanifested by no change in the material reality of society doesn't really mean much. Success doesn't mean money, it doesn't mean power, it means change.

Creation of future stuff is nicely encapsulated by the beginning of O'Shaughnessy's Ode,

Success, to me, isn't a commitment existing within the confinement of a reality as much as it is a commitment to creating a new one. The process of getting there is about making sure our dreams aren't lost in transmission. 

Concrete goals are the most common ways to define the destination: "Write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days." Jim Collins and Reid Hoffman call such things "vanity metrics" - a measure of what's measurable.

Vanity metrics are quite common in goal oriented thinking. People get the feeling that they are just drifting through time without a solid notion of orientation or enterprise to steer their intentions.  The measurable, the metric, is there to help guide them. Corporations make up "key performance indicators" - numerical benchmarks that are easy to compute and graph in excel. They can expect to see over a 6 month period that they are going up.

"Oh look at that improvement, this chart is going up!" is depression looking for meaning, futility looking for purpose, systemic failure seeking endogenous reinforcement. The numbers end up being the anti-depressant that fuels motivation by gamifying action and rationalizing the intent. It's a visible value creation from the ashes of our collective broken dreams.  The methods for the madness become the madness itself, incentives cannabalizing the goals.

Google has its own spin on this system they call OKR (objectives and key results) where they try to drape a behavioural blanket on top of KPIs to make them look bold, ambitious, adventurous and most of all, purposeful. 

I suppose that's something. I mean it's Google after all. They don't make mistakes, right?

The problem with these systems is there's a confluence of context that leads to a firm's success. They then have an adequate principle of management to not drop the ball too often and the management cabal sees this adequacy as some magnificent insight.

Among a successful enterprise, every segment looks at that company and attributes success to how that company implemented that segment.

This is important because it's not intrinsic. You don't have, for instance, interface wonks coming from Apple saying "our interface is what made us successful". Instead you have an interface industry looking for the most successful company, seeing Apple and saying "ah, their interface must be the reason".  You have the management industry looking at google and saying "ah, their management must be the reason". 

So was the wisdom in the 1970s business books when they were gushing over the F.W. Woolworth Company, Sears & Roebuck, and General Electric. As if their success was anything more than not having their shoelaces untied when it was time for them to dance.

This happens in engineering as well. Google comes out with a "MapReduce" paper and then all engineers believe they need to use that strategy to succeed. The shiny object claiming to be the heir apparent vehicle to ride the road going to somewhere called success constantly changes. It goes from Scrum to Agile, timeboxing, extreme programming, ruby on rails, NoSQL; a different magic trick every few weeks and a crowd of onlookers running around from one celebrity technology to the next. The magic is the act, not the tricks.

There is some silver bullet, we were told, that we all must emulate, in order to dance like them. Eventually all those companies collapsed, continuing to do their rain dances with more vigour and energy as their once great empires vanished.

And so we are, tribes of mythmakers, only differentiated from our ancestors by our material advantage but ultimately susceptible to the same pursuasions of reasons in a contradictory combination of self-relization and denial; some conflict of engagement where we know everything is futile and nothing is knowable while at the same time having an irrational faith that this claim itself is not true and not even our own eventual collapse and abandonment should be be taken as a given.

So then the dance itself becomes the purpose. The ambitions of salvation fall away and leave us with at least the satisfaction of the KPIs, the OKRs, the fact that we move our right foot when we're supposed to and at least win the game whose rules are a construction in our mind.

The nonsensical goal of writing a novel in 30 days while not shaving gives a historical narrative, something to look at, something to value. We need tangible things to place value on. The extreme nonsense of running a marathon in 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds and making it very important about how it's 1.06% faster than someone 4 years prior, that becomes the metric of value.

The exercise of futility, in proportion to how futile the goal is, and how hard it is to reach it, becomes the noteworthy endeavor. The man with 100 billion dollars isn't praised because there's more fundamental utility in it, but because there's a futility in it.

In a way, the heightening of the absurd is the thing of note. That's the purpose. The crippling of our dreams is because they fundamentally weren't absurd and meaningless enough. Maybe my 20 years of modesty are marked by a refusal to fully embrace this absurdity of life and permit reality to enfold around it.  A false notion, perhaps, that somehow such ridiculousness was the problem; it could actually be the very spirit I've been seeking that was never seized. The reachability of our realities are influenced by the stories we tell ourselves - we must permit ourselves to get closer.

I've been somewhat insured with the success of the company I'm at ever since I effectively did a mutiny about 13 months ago.  Since then we've done better as a company and I've focused on the material practicality of the business dynamics.  But we're asymptotically approaching a wall. That wall could be the wall of rationality.

The only way over it may be through proposterousness. The kind of proposterousness that says a college kid in a dorm could start the largest social networking website. The kind of stupidity that says the bitcoin thing that you can make 4 of in a single day will eventually be worth $20,000. By refusing to embrace the limits of absurdity, barriers of practicality, defined only by the existing paradigms, can't be overcome.

Maybe that's why young people tend to do so well with runaway successes - they don't perceive the walls of practicality and just dance past them without noticing while all the industry analysts look on predicting doom and failure and the young entreprenuer commits to an even more fantastic and ridiculous dance.  The masses, embrace the absurdity, the distance from reality, the denial of our own demise, the virtues of impracticality, and the dance continues. Everyone around them is trembling upon the mighty works and dispairing while the young ones don't seem to even notice them because they aren't trained to abide by the stories of the past.

The irrational exuberance of the mythmakers put on a show, build the tribe, and change the manufactured rules by which the world is supposed to operate.  Yet just as the ink on those books dry, another absurdist comes forth with a different dance, stealing the limelight yet again.

Has the world gone mad? The secret of humanity is that it was never sane to begin with.  So here I am, at a startup.  This month I shall increase the absurdity, heighten the contradictions, defy the gambits of rationality, all while expecting nothing and pretending as hard as I can that it's not just theatrical wanderings into the future.

The signal to noise ratio is crucial. Nonsense needs clean, transmittable purity to be captured and valued. The dance must be seen, understood, and believed in by the dancer to work. The way we sincerely commit to living our lives constitute the signal quality of the transmission of our dreams.

Authoritarian power dynamics constrain the possibility frontiers of future thought by limiting who is entrusted in exercising them. By reducing the number of participants, the number of perspectives, possibilities and their advocacies don't receive a rich articulation fully exercising the freedom of thought
