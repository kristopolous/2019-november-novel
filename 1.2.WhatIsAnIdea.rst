1.2 What is an Idea?
--------------------

Whole technologies exist in the service of another amorphous concept, the idea.

Ideas for the intent of our analysis are abstract destinations with the same properties as physical destinations. They can be an unknown distance, an unknown nature, or something we are quite familiar with. The physicality of a state of existence (such as place or being) as an abstract is the soul of the idea. [#]_

In practical terms, ideas are things that are simultaneously given up on and committed too. This ostensibly contradictory relationship is actually a core principle of many organizations and thought systems.  For instance, in religion there's an idea of "handing yourself over" to the God. Giving up is intrinsic to the commitment. It transforms the engagement into action.

12-step recovery programs share this similar contradiction of a commitment to powerless action. This fundamental contradiction is the platform upon which ideas grow.

Understanding this dynamic is crucial to understanding how ideas crystalize as a set of inclusive and exclusive memberships. Exploration happens before an idea has a name and its parameters are defined. As it is developed, fundamental compromises are made which crystalize and shape it. This leads to a focus of avenues of exploration. The potential values of early experiments on other avenues remain undeveloped and are mostly forgotten.

This is important, because when looking for categorical innovation or categorical divergence, looking early on is the best place to find it. It's those parts that were dismissed in one context that can be a critical solution to another.

Sometimes futures can be constructed from these parts of ideas not pursued. Insight, a craft of listening, isn't always engaged with by an objects creator.

1.2.1 Pre-semantic executions
=============================

In 1968, Douglas Engelbart was trying to demo his version of Vannevar Bush's memex machine from Atlantic Monthly (July 1945). In it he demos the Graphical User Interface, the first one really.  He has two novel input devices.  The first is the mouse, the second is something called the chorded keyset, a 5 key entry method.  These days it may look utterly bizarre

   Along with the mouse, Engelbart introduced a "chorded keyset" where input would be entered like playing a piano. 

Although the device on the left looks somewhat interesting and unfamiliar, it actually had a much richer precedence than the mouse: the punchcard and stenography machine. The idea of playing columns of a punchcard as a form of computer input like a stenography takes dictation sounds like a graceful innovative way to interact with a 1960s era computer.

This type of innovation where the initial perimeter is larger, more abstract, and more adventurous is endemic to early instances of things because it's not clear as to what something is or is not. 

Without such a consensus, there's amalgamations of previous systems placed into new ideas. 

These combinations are deviations of all things combined because they are constituting in a new way. Because certain things fail to gain purchase in the eventual contours of the notion of the thing, they continue to reside in an innovation purgatory, a set of roads not taken because of a context of the times which may no longer apply.

There's a deep richness to explore things before they have names.

Another example of this phenomena is the early smartphone entry by Nokia, the N9000. As opposed to the common iPhone-inspired full device as a screen or even the blackberry-inspired most of device as a screen with a small keyboard, the Communicator combined two existing forms, a palmtop computer and a phone, by placing the phone interface on the clamshell of the palmtop.

   The 1996 Nokia Communicator tried combining a palmtop computer with a portable phone through an innovative package. Not small enough for a pocket, but easily fittable in a briefcase or bag.

There's a wild possibility of a richness of innovation when we stop using the confinements of our categories and voluntarily step out of our reservations of thought.

Consciously availing ourselves to the possibilities of category deviations and permutations is one of the key ways that future happens.

The process of categorization is a required exercise to tell us about the kind of potential relationships some thing or idea can have. If we cannot find the potential of the process, skills, or releationships with the thing, then it doesn't have a proposition of value relating to anything else. The appreciability of values comes through relationships.

Hopes and dreams can have a crippling effect.

Importance of creating environments to express and opportunities to learn

There is no future. There's only now.

## Make tomorrow worth waiting for


This is because the more that's expected from something, the less action can be taken because the more significance is placed on any part.

Conversely, the less someone expects, the better they do. But the lack of expectations can't be merely theatrical - someone has to genuinely believe nothing is going to happen for things to happen. Imagination only moves when after a commitment to both dismissing reality and ignoring the past.  That's a required act to permit a new reality to be imagined, believed in, and acted upon.

Only through a sincere commitment to fiction can the future be made because all ideas and futures first form as a fiction before acted as a reality.  Faking things for others is fine but only through a true and faithful fakery can things truly change. That's the nature of imagination and ideation.

1.2.2 False Maps to Reality
===========================

Amorphous words like "success" unmanifested by no change in the material reality of society doesn't really mean much. For the purposes of this text success doesn't mean greater money or greater power, it means a change in the dynamics of power and money. 

Part of this is the idea of success being "to make some thing happen" or "to [have agency](make) [over a relation or mechanism](some thing) [intrumented towards a goal](happen)"

The "false map" here comes from another model of reality which will be explored in 2.1 which comes from an illusion of focus: human relationship dynamics and mechanics are consistent, knowable, and describable and simply scale by a linear multiplier called "progress" or perhaps, in exceptionalist lenses, "greatness". In this model, the individuals playing the roles change so therefore success is an individualized endeavor to change ones role in this constant forever pecking order of society.

This is a dominant, alternative, view of progress and success; a self-driven individual using techniques to amount a pile of cash.

The illusion of focus is a "forcing" of systems into linear narratives that by their construction, implicitly define subsequent steps. They presume an end of history and the infinite present as a foundation for this construction to work.

If the goal isn't future stuff and authority is valued more than discovery, control valued more than exploration, and knowns valued more than unknowns then this model works fine. The perpetuation of the present is not infinite but it is usually free of shock enough to work within it.

But this isn't the creation of future stuff. The fundamental problem with this dynastic system is the accelerated temporality of dynasties. The anticipation of disorder is the new order as it will happen with or without, perhaps even once a decade. [#]_

This creation of future stuff is nicely encapsulated by the beginning of O'Shaughnessy's Ode, 
> We are the music makers, And we are the dreamers of dreams, 
> Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
> And sitting by desolate streams;
> â€” World-losers and world-forsakers, 
> On whom the pale moon gleams: 
> Yet we are the movers and shakers 
> Of the world for ever, it seems.

Success isn't a commitment existing within the confinement of a reality as much as it is a commitment to creating a new one. The process of getting there is about making sure our dreams aren't lost in transmission. 

There's a number of common ways presented to get there. The first we'll look at is measureable metrics.

Concrete goals are the most common ways to define the destination. For instance, the goal of say, "Write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days." is a goal, it's achievable, but it's not very meaningful because it's extrinsic to any reality beyond the goal. There is no meaning beyond hitting the number. It's not an idea, it's not a future, it's just a game. Jim Collins and Reid Hoffman call such things "vanity metrics". By having a concrete goal be a quantitative measure of what's measurable, we can organize and graph things fine, but all futures that come of it are merely incidental, done in spite of, and not because of the system.

Vanity metrics are quite common in goal-oriented thinking. Many get the feeling that they are just drifting through time without a solid notion of orientation or enterprise to steer their intentions.  The measurable, the metric, is there to help guide them. Corporations make up "key performance indicators" - numerical benchmarks that are easy to compute and graph in excel. They can expect to see over a 6 month period that they are going up.

If selling an idea is more important than selling an object, the problem with KPIs is they become the idea that is sold in place of the goal. It's yet another form of object fetishism, like swapping the bag of sand for the priceless jewel.

"Oh look at that improvement, this chart is going up!" is depression looking for meaning, futility looking for purpose, systemic failure seeking endogenous reinforcement. The numbers end up being the anti-depressant that fuels motivation by gamifying action and rationalizing the intent. It's a visible value creation from the ashes of our collective broken dreams.  The methods for the madness become the madness itself, incentives cannabalizing the goals.

Google has its own spin on this system they call OKR (objectives and key results) where they try to drape a behavioural blanket on top of KPIs to make them look bold, ambitious, adventurous and most of all, purposeful. 

I suppose that's something. I mean it's Google after all. They don't make mistakes, right?

The problem with these systems is there's a confluence of context that leads to a firm's success. They then have an adequate principle of management to not drop the ball too often and the management cabal sees this adequacy as some magnificent insight.

Among a successful enterprise, every segment looks at that company and attributes success to how that company implemented that segment.

This is important because it's not intrinsic. You don't have, for instance, interface wonks coming from Apple saying "our interface is what made us successful". Instead you have an interface industry looking for the most successful company, seeing Apple and saying "ah, their interface must be the reason".  You have the management industry looking at google and saying "ah, their management must be the reason". 

So was the wisdom in the 1970s business books when they were gushing over the F.W. Woolworth Company, Sears & Roebuck, and General Electric. As if their success was anything more than not having their shoelaces untied when it was time for them to dance.

This happens in engineering as well. Google comes out with a "MapReduce" paper and then all engineers believe they need to use that strategy to succeed. The shiny object claiming to be the heir apparent vehicle to ride the road going to somewhere called success constantly changes. It goes from Scrum to Agile, timeboxing, extreme programming, ruby on rails, NoSQL; a different magic trick every few weeks and a crowd of onlookers running around from one celebrity technology to the next. The magic is the act, not the tricks. 

With respect to ideas, the velocity of innovation is more important than an emulation of the past.

There is some silver bullet, we were told, that we all must emulate, in order to dance like them. Eventually all those companies collapsed, continuing to do their rain dances with more vigour and energy as their once great empires vanished.

And so we are, tribes of mythmakers, only differentiated from our ancestors by our material advantage but ultimately susceptible to the same pursuasions of reasons in a contradictory combination of self-relization and denial; some conflict of engagement where we know everything is futile and nothing is knowable while at the same time having an irrational faith that this claim itself is not true and not even our own eventual collapse and abandonment should be be taken as a given.

So then the dance itself becomes the purpose. The ambitions of salvation fall away and leave us with at least the satisfaction of the KPIs, the OKRs, the fact that we move our right foot when we're supposed to and at least win the game whose rules are a construction in our mind.

We need tangible things to place value on. The extreme nonsense of running a marathon in 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds and making it very important about how it's 1.06% faster than someone 4 years prior, that becomes the metric of value.

The exercise of futility, in proportion to how futile the goal is, and how hard it is to reach it, becomes the noteworthy endeavor. The man with 100 billion dollars isn't praised because there's more fundamental utility in it, but because there's a futility in it.

In a way, the heightening of the absurd is the thing of note. That's the purpose. The crippling of our dreams is because they fundamentally weren't absurd and meaningless enough. Maybe my 20 years of modesty are marked by a refusal to fully embrace this absurdity of life and permit reality to enfold around it.  A false notion, perhaps, that somehow such ridiculousness was the problem; it could actually be the very spirit I've been seeking that was never seized. The reachability of our realities are influenced by the stories we tell ourselves - we must permit ourselves to get closer.

I've been somewhat insured with the success of the company I'm at ever since I effectively did a mutiny about 13 months ago.  Since then we've done better as a company and I've focused on the material practicality of the business dynamics.  But we're asymptotically approaching a wall. That wall could be the wall of rationality.

The only way over it may be through proposterousness. The kind of proposterousness that says a college kid in a dorm could start the largest social networking website. The kind of stupidity that says the bitcoin thing that you can make 4 of in a single day will eventually be worth $20,000. By refusing to embrace the limits of absurdity, barriers of practicality, defined only by the existing paradigms, can't be overcome.

Maybe that's why young people tend to do so well with runaway successes - they don't perceive the walls of practicality and just dance past them without noticing while all the industry analysts look on predicting doom and failure and the young entreprenuer commits to an even more fantastic and ridiculous dance.  The masses, embrace the absurdity, the distance from reality, the denial of our own demise, the virtues of impracticality, and the dance continues. Everyone around them is trembling upon the mighty works and dispairing while the young ones don't seem to even notice them because they aren't trained to abide by the stories of the past.

The irrational exuberance of the mythmakers put on a show, build the tribe, and change the manufactured rules by which the world is supposed to operate.  Yet just as the ink on those books dry, another absurdist comes forth with a different dance, stealing the limelight yet again.

Has the world gone mad? The secret of humanity is that it was never sane to begin with.  So here I am, at a startup.  This month I shall increase the absurdity, heighten the contradictions, defy the gambits of rationality, all while expecting nothing and pretending as hard as I can that it's not just theatrical wanderings into the future.

The signal to noise ratio is crucial. Nonsense needs clean, transmittable purity to be captured and valued. The dance must be seen, understood, and believed in by the dancer to work. The way we sincerely commit to living our lives constitute the signal quality of the transmission of our dreams.

Notes
*****

.. [#] There's a philosophical pedigree about ideas and perception that goes back to the dawn of modern philosophy (see Plato, Descartes, Locke, Hume, etc.). Since we are confining the text into "future thought" we confine the notion of idea within that context. This text intentionally confines things in order to define them. The goal is to construct a repeatable, actionable, but abstract enough to be perpetually unique framework of thought which can be identified and applied as a method. The frontier of concepts like "idea" become a lot less relevant when we commit to drawing our own perimeters around them.
.. [#] Software engineering is a good example. It's not that the language and practice of the industry changes quickly (it does) but the systems and products fundamentally change. Software has gone from the mainframe to the minicomputer to the desktop to the smart phone in the length of someone's career. Each level is fundamentally different in how things are designed, who is using the devices, for what purpose, where the data lives, what the nature of the data is, etc. For instance, a smart phone with dozens of accounts, an email server, and a handful of remote terminals makes as much sense as a touchscreen on a mainframe for setting up romantic dates with various other mainframe operators around town. The illusion of focus works temporarily if the actions are swift enough but it's ultimately a short-lived enterprise as evident by the number of successful mainframe software companies (there's a few with the institutional capability to construct and deploy supercomputers such as Cray (now HP), IBM, and Fujitsu, but it's a retreat to the highest end of the market with only governments as clients)
