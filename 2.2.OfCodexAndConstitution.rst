2 Of codex and constitutions
----------------------------

Before machines, before the rise of the modern philosophy of science by Francis Bacon in his 1620 work, Novum Organum, technology existed.

The technology of agriculture and hunting, food storage and preparation, shelter and violence, the world was awash in the traditionalist definition of tool technology.

Whether its the ancient aztec and chinese calendars, used to predict the seasons or the artifacts of not yet agreed upon use such as the Baghdad battery and antikythera mechanism, the entire world has been in the quest of technology for time immemorial.

What though, is the people/process/tools technology that defined the structure of the era?  There's really two

 * the structuring of people and purpose through laws and legal logics

 * navigation and communication technology through celestial calendars, arithmatic, measuring devices and the written word

These did not exist as separate tracks but instead as self-referential systems. For instance, 16th century imperialist conquest was made possible only by novel financial instruments, banking institutions, and innovation in property law.

There is debate among paleontologists of when "modern" humans first emerged but it's generally agreed upon that by 200,000 years ago for all intents and purposes we had modern humans.

Then there is a large unknown region until the beginning of the Holocene about 10,000 years ago after which we start getting more and more reliable records.

What happened in the first 95% of the modern human? There's quite a bit of questionable speculation and this is not a book about that.  Instead, it's about why, if these peoples had the ability to create complex language, form cities, and do all the behavorial patterns of the upper paleolithic, did they not do so?
