Technology in the 20th century also had the implication of these three types but in a different way.

By now this should be expected, that the future is about a reordering of structure and redefinition of terms.

The paradigmatic pattern that was repeated 4 times was as follows:

 * A new communication tool is invented
 * Commercialization on it is initially forbidden
 * It is seen as a March of Intellect with the ability to upend old structures and enlighten the masses
 * Commercialization and a gold rush commences
 * The technology upends previously unacknowledged structures and creates new ones
 * New power potential is made, undefined at first, then eventually filled as goals and power structures are redefined or reorchestrated
