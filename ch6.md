Technology in the 20th century also had the implication of these three types but in a different way.

By now this should be expected, that the future is about a reordering of structure and redefinition of terms.

The paradigmatic pattern that was repeated 4 times was as follows:

 * A new communication tool is invented
 * Commercialization on it is initially forbidden
 * It is seen as a March of Intellect with the ability to upend old structures and enlighten the masses
 * Commercialization and a gold rush commences
 * The technology upends previously unacknowledged structures and creates new ones
 * New power potential is made, undefined at first, then eventually filled as goals and power structures are redefined or reorchestrated
 * A second, smaller scale wave happens at the end of the technological relevance curve

The four structures and substructures are as follows

 1. One way radio
    a. Mass produced audio recordings
 2. Television
    b. Mass produced video recordings
 3. Two way radio and eventually cell phones
 4. Online services and the internet

These all developed along similar patterns with similar processes and similar results.

The first example will be the bridging technology between the two centuries, the rise of the daily newspaper.

The daily newspaper was only possible in a society of literate, same language people. The people had to have acquired the skills to read, the process of the newsroom had to exist, and the tools of the mechanical typesetting machine and cheap on the fly mass production had to exist. If any one of these didn't work, the system as a whole wouldn't have.
