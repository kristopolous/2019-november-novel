Technology in the 20th century also had the implication of these three types but in a different way.

By now this should be expected, that the future is about a reordering of structure and redefinition of terms.

The paradigmatic pattern that was repeated 4 times was as follows:

 * A new communication tool is invented
 * Commercialization on it is initially forbidden or nascent
 * It is seen as a March of Intellect with the ability to upend old structures and enlighten the masses
 * Commercialization and a gold rush commences
 * The technology upends previously unacknowledged structures and creates new ones
 * New power potential is made, undefined at first, then eventually filled as goals and power structures are redefined or reorchestrated
 * A second, smaller scale wave happens at the end of the technological relevance curve

The four structures and substructures are as follows

 1. One way radio

    a. Mass produced audio recordings

 2. Television

    b. Mass produced video recordings

 3. Two way radio and eventually cell phones
 4. Online services and the internet

These all developed along similar patterns with similar processes and similar results.

The first example will be the bridging technology between the two centuries, the rise of the daily newspaper.

The future shaping impact of the daily newspaper was only possible in a society of literate people. These people had to have acquired the skills to read, the process of the newsroom and organizational structure of gathering news had to exist, and the tools of both electronic wire communication, mechanical type-casting machine, and cheap on the fly mass production had to exist. If any one of these didn't work, the system as a whole wouldn't have.

Newspapers, defined as a periodic, universal, publicly accessible, and current (as opposed to say, the kind of historical analysis this book offers) had been around, without dispute since at least 1605. By the 1660s, newspapers were available in France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and to German and Italian speakers. Provided mostly at-cost or at small profit, publications were viewed as a public service as a more reliable way to get information.

But the mere existence of tool of newspaper wasn't enough. It wasn't until nearly 200 years later, in the 1810s, that the tool of the printing presses, capable of making over 1,000 impressions per hour, on both sides, existed.

In the 1830s, a new innovation, relying on commercialization through advertising as opposed to a mostly at-cost subscription model, led to the introduction of a "penny press".  This along with the massive reduction in the price of a paper, process, and printing tools gave way to an explosion of cheap periodicals, costing 1/6th the price of the other offerings.

The penny press captured a new emerging market, due to being 83% less costly, and covered different material than what was targeted towards the upper class such as sports, crime news, and gossip. Their variations today would be closest to tabloids.

By the 1840s we had 

 * people skills: public literacy and a skill of sensationalist writing towards a mass audience 
 * process: a financial model based on advertising, simple language, and daily publications
 * tools: mass print machines, photography, railroads, and the telegraph

Additionally, wood pulp pressing was developed in the 1840s to further reduce costs and increase the size of newspapers.

This groundwork of people, process, and tool technology should now be in place for a realignment of goals, a disruption of process, and a new dynamic to emerge. Furthermore, these technologies, some in the works for 200 years, would not have been able to have affected things independently.

In 1843, a Parisian newspaper named *La Réforme* started publication. Some of the regular contributors included Karl Marx (who later became the editor of his own paper, *Neue Rheinische Zeitung* in 1848), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first person to call himself an anarchist, and a journalist at three other newspapers, and Mikhail Bakunin, regarded as one of the most important anarchists in the 19th century.

After the 1848 French revolution, the members of *La Réforme* were made part of the provisional French government. The disruptive technology in a disrupted society was put in charge of controlling it, and really didn't know what to do with it.  In 1848 Paris, even though 54% of the businesses had left the cities, 479 newspapers were founded, many not in the French language.  The undefined power vacuum, in the midst of the second revolution happened because the paper made the news events and now the news events made the paper.

Papers with news from from Paris were stocked on trains which would take 2-3 days to go to other cities where people would line up and buy them in a frenzy. Those lucky enough to get a copy would often do things like stand on tables at coffee houses, reading it aloud to the others in the room.

That is future, that is technology. That is tomorrow.

| *The news from Paris became the primary business of Paris, as hundreds of small papers prepare publications for the trains in the middle of the night, from L'Illustration, Journal Universel, 1848* |

As the media companies that came after it, the newspaper, in this time, was poised to become the Silicon Valley of its era due to the interaction of the three columns of techology.

Cutting-edge tools and processes allowed for photographs to be included in newspapers through various engraving techniques, effectively tracing a photograph onto an engraving plate.  The first photograph to be used in a paper was of war barricades out of Paris in 1848, taken June 25, 1848, "Barricades rue Saint-Maur. Avant l'attaque" and included in L'Illustration in 1-8 July of that year.

Five years later, by the time the Crimean war broke out, photojournalism, telegraphy, cheap wood pulp printing, a literate public, and transport by trains, had come together.

Publications such as The London Illustrated News, prominantly featured daguerreotyphic engravings, often multiple ones on each page documenting the war. Capturing compelling photographs were so important for the sale of the paper that sometimes they were staged. Researchers have uncovered, for instance, a second version of Roger Fenton's "Valley of the Shadow of Death", which features numerous canonballs on a roadside, with far fewer canonballs.  Apparently, in order to create a more sensationalist photograph, canonballs might have been transferred into the frame in order to assist the narrative.

At the beginning of the war, in 1853, it took about 4 days for news to reach London. In 1854, a new telegraph to the French coast reduced it to 2 days and the following year, an undersea cable reduced it to a few hours.  

This is a 25-fold speed increase in 2 years. Like the French revolution, the Crimean war became a significant news event.  For London, so much so, that it led to the ascension of one of the british commanders, Viscount Palmerston, to the cabinet of Prime Minister.

The tech boom was underway and reality was being redefined

As the century went on, large newspaper empires formed and some of the wealthiest people of the 19th century came to their riches from the newspaper or the manipulation of it.

The power of the press was so captured by the imagination of the people of the time, that even ficticious stories were passed around to attribute to wealth to people.  For example, in 1846, a French pamphlet made a false claim that Nathan Mayer Rothschild had early access to war news, falsely reported it, sending the market into freefall, then swooped up ownership of the shares before it was corrected, making significant profit.  However, there's no public record of such large volume trading that day, a market crash and rebound or of false, then true news being reported.  The material evidence is not there.  The frenzy of the potential of newspaper technology to be the tool that constructs the future, however, so captured the imagination, that it did not matter.  The apocryphal narrative caught on and is still repeated as if it actually happened to this day.

The people who actually did make their millions in newspapers, in the US, occupied a part of manahatten known as Park Row.
It was home to some of the earliest examples of skyscrapers. In the same way that people today speak of the flashy wealth and future orientation of the tech giants, at the late 19th century, the same thing was said about the newspaper giants.
