Technology in the 20th century also had the implication of these three types but in a different way.

By now this should be expected, that the future is about a reordering of structure and redefinition of terms.

The paradigmatic pattern that was repeated 4 times was as follows:

 * A new communication tool is invented
 * Commercialization on it is initially forbidden or nascent
 * It is seen as a March of Intellect with the ability to upend old structures and enlighten the masses
 * Commercialization and a gold rush commences
 * The technology upends previously unacknowledged structures and creates new ones
 * New power potential is made, undefined at first, then eventually filled as goals and power structures are redefined or reorchestrated
 * A second, smaller scale wave happens at the end of the technological relevance curve

The four structures and substructures are as follows

 1. One way radio
    a. Mass produced audio recordings
 2. Television
    b. Mass produced video recordings
 3. Two way radio and eventually cell phones
 4. Online services and the internet

These all developed along similar patterns with similar processes and similar results.

The first example will be the bridging technology between the two centuries, the rise of the daily newspaper.

The future shaping impact of the daily newspaper was only possible in a society of literate people. These people had to have acquired the skills to read, the process of the newsroom and organizational structure of gathering news had to exist, and the tools of both electronic wire communication, mechanical type-casting machine, and cheap on the fly mass production had to exist. If any one of these didn't work, the system as a whole wouldn't have.

Newspapers, defined as a periodic, universal, publicly accessible, and current (as opposed to say, the kind of historical analysis this book offers) had been around, without dispute since at least 1605. By the 1660s, newspapers were available in France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and to German and Italian speakers. Provided mostly at-cost or at small profit, publications were viewed as a public service as a more reliable way to get information.

But the mere existence of tool of newspaper wasn't enough. It wasn't until nearly 200 years later, in the 1810s, that the tool of the printing presses, capable of making over 1,000 impressions per hour, on both sides, existed.

In the 1830s, a new innovation, relying on commercialization through advertising as opposed to a mostly at-cost subscription model, led to the introduction of a "penny press".  This along with the massive reduction in the price of a paper, process, and printing tools gave way to an explosion of cheap periodicals, costing 1/6th the price of the other offerings.

The penny press captured a new emerging market, due to being 83% less costly, and covered different material than what was targeted towards the upper class such as sports, crime news, and gossip. Their variations today would be closest to tabloids.

By the 1840s we had 

 * people skills: public literacy and a skill of sensationalist writing towards a mass audience 
 * process: a financial model based on advertising, simple language, and daily publications
 * tools: mass print machines, photography, railroads, and the telegraph

Additionally, wood pulp pressing was developed in the 1840s to further reduce costs and increase the size of newspapers.

This groundwork of people, process, and tool technology should now be in place for a realignment of goals, a disruption of process, and a new dynamic to emerge. Furthermore, these technologies, some in the works for 200 years, would not have been able to have affected things independently.

In 1843, a Parisian newspaper named La RÃ©forme started publication. Some of the regular contributors included the Karl Marx (who later became the editor of his own paper, Neue Rheinische Zeitung in 1848), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first person to call himself an anarchist, and a journalist at 4 newspapers, and Mikhail Bakunin, regarded as one of the most important anarchists in the 19th century.

After the 1848 french revolution, the members of the paper were made part of the provisional government. In 1848 Paris, even though 54% of the businesses had left the cities, 479 newspapers were founded, many not in the French language.  The undefined power vacuum, in the midst of the second revolution happened because the paper made the news and now the news made the paper.

Papers with from news from Paris were stocked on trains which would take 2-3 days to go to other cities where people would line up at the train station and sell in a frenzy. People who were lucky enough to get a copy would often do things like stand on tables at coffee houses, reading it aloud to the others in the room.

That is future, that is technology. That is tomorrow.

As the media companies that came after it, the newspaper at one time, was the Silicon Valley of its era.

Instead, it was called Park Row and was home to some of the earliest examples of skyscrapers. In the same way that people today speak of the flashy wealth and future orientation of the tech giants, at the late 19th century, the same thing was said about the newspaper giants.
