1.3 Constructs and modalities of future-thought
-----------------------------------------------

> "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination."
*Frederick P. Brooks Jr., The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering*

10-20-30 year rule
------------------

In the early 2000s, I distinctly remember two events:

 * the first time I saw a color cell phone that could take a picture
 * the first time I saw a car stereo system with a touch screen

I remember feeling the level of engagement felt like an old computer.  I started cataloging these migrations. When things went from:

 * no display, to a crude LED single line display (like a microwave), to a black and white display, to finally a color display.
 * no customization, to a binary customization, to a multi-dimensional customization, to one with custom applications.
 * no storage, to storage of current state, to storage of previous state, to storage of things you didn't think were stored at all.

Essentially there was a dissemination of tools, as features, trickling down a hierarchy of objects. The costs were reduces, societies engagement with the object became more diverse and the objects themselves played a greater role in our lives.

I coined this as the 10-20-30 year rule essentially saying that there's 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th class tools which have more or less a 10, 20, and 30 year lag.  The tool itself, in this case, the computer, is the 1st class tool.  The 2nd class tools are those of high engagement featuring the properties of the 1st class tool, such as cell phones and tablet computers.  For instance, as of this writing, the iPhone 11 has 4GB of memory.  The MacBook, by the same company, 10 years prior, also had 4GB of memory.

The 3rd class are smart appliances such as smart TVs, ATMs, and kiosks.  The 4th class are things with limited engagement such as microwaves, refrigerators and greeting cards.

Seeing such things as "behind the times" is an inaccurate, not future-oriented portrayel. Instead, the dissemination and integration of future stuff has a long-term transformative effect which ripples downmarket like the shockwave of an earthquake. But at every point in that downmarket, a new visionary approach has to be realized to justify its existence.  For instance, a sophisticated color touch-screen microwave would need a new justifiable reason for it to exist.

Although things can be simply slapped on devices in the sole purpose of being flashy, there isn't long term market acceptance until a need arrives.  There has to be an underlying justifiable vision.  Those come with time as the potential applications of new tools to do old things in new ways materialize in the headspace of both the consumer and producer

1-9-90: The lifeblood of innovation
-----------------------------------

I'm instrumental in two companies right now.  The first one is an advertising technology firm that has screens on top of cars and the second one is a company that is trying to make financial games.

The first one, which is the only one that currently pays the bills, will be dealt with in later chapters. The second company is better for introducing some premises here, and it's what I worked on today.

I'm a software developer who recently gained interest in the business world but not out of any deep drive for competition or to make oodles of money. Instead it's how I saw any meaningful change, with engineering contributions, happen in the world.

At the time I was constantly baffled by how poor executions of rather useless technology, often just knockoffs of already existing things, ended up being seen as these breakthrough successes in the marketplace with hoardes of people liberally using all caps and exclamation points when describing it. 

Apple would release a product using a technology which had been around for 15 years, but for some reason, this was the first time people had actually seen it, so they'd falsely attribute innovation to Apple. 

Even in the software development world, where people should know better, I'd read comments gushing over some technology which does effectively the exact same thing as something else which had been in wide use for years, sometimes decades. 

I always looked on these with the same question: "How on earth is this news? Why do people act like this? Are they just all idiots? What gives?"

A number of years ago, I formalized what I saw as the "1-9-90" rule to explain this phenomena:  Successfully building a future is 1% idea, 9% implementation, and 90% "marketing".  

Marketing here includes not only the description of the product/place/price/promotion in some traditional "marketing mix" but also the assumed personality of the people developing it, their social connections, the style and colors of things like the documentation website, the size of the tribe that says positive things about it, etc, effectively the business (ie, human) side of a product.

In other words, to an engineer in the trenches, success is 90% "bullshit" that shouldn't, but absolutely does matter. I had been missing something.

The claim of 90% is important because it implies that the other part, as in what the thing actually is and what constitutes it, almost doesn't matter at all.

You can see this clearly demonstrated in mid 90s pop music. Take the average boy band: 

  * Their idea: yet another love song, identical to hundreds of others
  * Their execution: a quartet in a 100 year old configuration singing a song following a pop format that had been established for 50 years. 

Those parts as it turns out, don't actually matter at all. They simply need to exist, their quality and originality play no role.

What the boys looked like, what the music video accompanying it looked like, how it was promoted, this was the only determining factor in the overall success.  This is how humanity actually operates.

To be more specific, some of the hit songs of the era, such as the Fugee's Killing me softly, were just cover songs.  In this case, there had been 75 previous covers of that song spanning back 25 years. 

Obviously the content, originality, idea, none of this mattered. The 76th cover of a 25 year old song was a big hit only because of the marketing, that's why that part constitutes 90%. Most people didn't know it wasn't an original song, especially one that had been covered by hit artists dozens of times. Narrative and truth is a construction of the 4ps of marketing. Objective reality, unless it's materially limiting, if not known, ultimately has no effect.

The 1-9-90 importantly is not a linear process. It's an interaction of different components. Imagine a long beam on a fulcrum that's right near one side so that a little movement on one side creates a huge change on the other.  As a "build-measure-learn" cycle (see The Lean Startup, Eric Reis, 2011) moves, this is the mechanics of the clockwork. Each column informs the other and modifies it accordingly maintaining the multiplier effect implied.

I first noticed this pattern far earlier, probably in the 90s.  For years I was incensed that the world worked this way, where the symbolic pageantry surrounding the thing was the actual thing of engagement while the substantive thing instead acted as a mere edifice upon which these ceremonies took place. Eventually I succumbed to the inanity of culture.

If the actual machinery of the world is constituted by these gears of irrelevance, I might as well discover how they operate. I had a sense early on that trying to shoehorn human action into a framework of rationality required the assumption that people are inherently rational - I had become utterly convinced they weren't.

Instead, I saw emotional, impulsive people responding unpredictably to false and incomplete beliefs all around me.

Rational agency, instead of being inherent to the human condition, is a trained capacity, within the capability of human expression, but not cultivated or expressed as some core constituency.


Future Orienting 
-----------------

Using absurdism as the guiding principle in the creation of future-stuff with thought-stuff requires an intentional exercise of diligence on the practice of absurdism.

Going back to the 1-9-90 rule we can take those pieces and subdivide them out into a new category we'll call intentionality. Intentionality is elusive and ephemeral.  Laws are differentiated based on intentionality:  Did someone murderously drive their car into a person out of bloodlust or was it an unfortunate accident? Did a politician do some act in order to benefit themselves or did such a thing just happen by coincidence? Intentionality is a non-tangible thing that arguably exists both outside the act AND as an essential component. It both drives the underlying mechanics and forms the reality but doesn't actually exist beyond abstraction. 

Intentionality is an extrinsically assigned attribution and an intrinsically directed motivation and is the connective tissue that ties the 1-9-90 pieces together.  Unless explicitly stated, it can never truly be derived, only assigned.  Sometimes erroneously, sometimes ambiguously, and often controversially.

Intentionality, at its best is an act of coherency, clarity, depth and sincerity. It provides a story for any action as a specific kind of story called a "reason". But because intentionality is inherently assigned, the assigner of the intention is free to reclassify reasons into another bin called excuses in order to not have to change their perception.  This exercise is used to resolve a cognitive dissonance; when faced with realities that do not match perceptions, people either shift the intentionality to match the perception, change the perception of intentionality, or change their material reality to match the perception.

When creating new things, we want the material reality to change to match the new perception.  We can do this by making the new thing have a strong "value of being", what chapter 1 called "embracing the absurdity to move beyond the wall of practicality".

When our act of creation is lacking in adequate intentionality, the objects of that creation lack a value of being.  

"Value of being" is the attribution of existence as a disconnected, independent entity where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. An object has a value of being when it can be named, identified, and described by what it is and more importantly, what it is not. It is an endless horizon of future possibilities confined by a specific geometry of thought. For instance, an iPhone 5 has a value of being, while the, say LG VX8300 does not. 

The value of being is a direct result of the focus of and attention to the intentionality on its creation. The object is a result of the organizational process of the designers. The perception and intentionality of the thing can be orchestrated, controlled and directed.

This is discussed at length in Dynamics of Software Development, 1995, by Jim McCarthy and the Pulitzer Prize winning The Soul of A New Machine, 1981, by Tracy Kidder (the latter of which is quoted in the discussion of this concept in The Innovators Dilemma, 1997, by Clayton M. Christensen).

The object created is a consequence of the process of creating that object. To what degree and under what aspect that process had intentionality is apparent as a thematic feature in the final product.

Recently at the gaming company, we met a guy who wanted to volunteer a redesign of what we made. A few days later he texted us a few screenshots of his design. 

We both thought they were truly awful, just terrible. I tried asking myself why that was both of our reaction. It wasn't the color choices - they were common colors. It wasn't the arrangement of content or fonts, it was common, fairly by the book and easy to understand.

I thought hard about what I didn't like about it. I asked him what the goals were.  He said "something that was simple and intuitive for people to use".  That intentionality and its lack of geometry is the problem!

Broad-based descriptions like "simple and intuitive" are goals of any project, any creation, any thing - they are not things that are specific to some thing.

Al Ries informs this analysis in "22 Immutable laws of marketing", 1993. In the 5th chapter on the Law of Focus he says you can't narrow the focus with something that doesn't have proponents of the other side. For instance, "simple and intuitive" can't be a focus because nobody would say "I really wanted the product to be complicated and unintelligible".  Thus, because there wasn't enough of a narrow, contoured, opinion there wasn't enough direction to drive a coherency.

As a result, the design was undesigned: it had poor vision, an unrefined intentionality, a lack of goal-oriented orientation that led to what appeared to be ultimately a disconnected thing with a low value of being. The object is lacking in notions of independent existence and worth.  

A successful execution would have had a tightness and flow, a percievable crispness of thought and a coherency of intention. This is what Robert M. Pirsig calls "quality" in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, 1974.  In this book, he finds it very daunting that his notion of western thought didn't encompass such a qualitatively discernable but ultimately unmeasurable thing as quality.

45 years later, I'm going to attempt to pick up where he left off. Quality is the intersection of audacity, intention, coherency, absurdity (often referred to as the AICA model from here out). Each of these truly intersects, refines, and informs the other in that they must function in concert with each other to get to the ultimate idea of quality, which is the essence, or value of being.

I've been on the search when thinking about this whether absurdity and audacity are a product of the times or a timeless product. The core question is whether in different contexts other words may replace them.

Without an insistence on a removal from current reality through audacity and absurdity, there will forever exist the wall of practicality that confines the existence of some thing to be a construct of the past and not the building blocks of a future. That's the true difference between the LG VX8300 and the iPhone, the former is a constitution of the present while the latter is a proposal for the future.

However, if things are merely audacious or absurd without coherency or intentionality, there is noise in the signal of vision that's transmitted which uses the created object as a medium of the vision - there is a lack of clarity and a fuzziness of defition. 

Many people get this reaction with modern art. At its best, modern art is supposed to make you question things and be the start of a conversation. The coherency and direction of this conversation is often left intentionally unclear, but focused and guided by certain possibilities within the object of the art. Its value of being is both disconnected from and an extension of the ontological systems we use to make sense in the world.  But because it's a layer upon the individual's ontology, it doesn't become a conversant experience. It is collective, individual, and sharable, but the elusive identifiability of the work, by its very nature, leaves it undiscussable and undefinable in any inarguable way beyond a pure material description.

Take for example the end of the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Much ink has been spilled over trying to narrow the meaning and focus of it to a concrete narrative reality, a value of being that is conversant and communicable in a way that doesn't necessitate the thing itself; a way to construct its meaning using the language of shared experience.

The whole point in its construction was to defy that goal: to remain beyond the ontology of familiarity, outside the concreteness of reality, defined in future, foreign, alien terms that appear to have a coherency, appear to have an intentionality, appear to have all the values of being but yet elude us in the capture of its essence.

Enough connections to the real are severed to make it ultimately unrelatable. That's the point. That's what the disconnect between now and an alien world would be; it's in direct contrast to HAL, which is a familiar value of being, almost to an extreme extent. It is humanity manifested - the calculated indifference and banality of conquest.  We see laid bare, if we wish to look, the two modalities of future creation; one that is a mere extension of our value network and another which is a different system of being.

The balance beween absurdity, audacity, intention, and coherency represents the continuum between these two representations. All of them are gradually tweaked throughout the duration of the film.

When focused on designing a future and attempting to build it, deciding where to be on these 4 dimensions, between modesty and audacity, seriousness and absurdity, disregard and intention, incongruity and coherency and making sure the systems of building, the process of construction, reflect the goals of the product, is the essence in creating a value of being.

When dealing with disruptive (as opposed to sustaining) innovations in emerging (as opposed to established) markets, the value proposition and purpose of the new product needs to be explained through the thing itself to a newly collected group of individuals which constitute a market for that product. This process is inherently challenging because it requires new channels to be made to get to that new, unproven, perhaps phantom, market.

Unlike with sustaining innovations or established markets, the product *has to* sell itself. A traditional sales team is an accelerant to this process but will not succeed unless the product, which means the construction, which means the process to create it and the organizations and structures therein, have the level of absurdity, audacity, intention, and coherency to *manufacture a market*. The 1-9-90 columns continually inform each other through these mechanisms.

In the next chapter we'll go over how the technology of screens on top of cars is a disruptive innovation which needs to find emerging markets because it's a downmarket innovation with a different value system for a different, as of yet, unproven demographic of users.

Additionally, I'll discuss how the product encompasses all those properties and how I've structured the team that is creating it around these principles.
