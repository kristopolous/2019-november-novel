2.6 A Tale of two Governments
-----------------------------

Let's look at two 40 year periods, 1930-1970 and 1970-2010. A dramatic number of tools and firsts happened in the era:

  1930 - 1970: World War 2, the United Nations, the Atomic Bomb, the Computer, Moon landing,
  1970 - 2010: Personal computer, mobile phone, internet, Vietnam war, cimate change decline of smoking

The 1930 - 1970 is tied together by a cultural belief that there is a society, a collective governing force that can be empowered, orchestrated, and directed.  1970 - 2010 is tied together by a cultural belief that there isn't a society, there is no collective governing force, it cannot be orchestrated or directed so don't empower it.

This radical pivot changed the perimeter of the possible. The devolving of the collective to the individual, may to socialists appear as some devious treachery by the ruling class, however, this perhaps ill-place and inccorect notion of rugged individualism is a result of the democratization of the means due to the commodification of the media.

The individual, imagined as the producer, consumer, and entire system of marxian economic reproduction led to a shaping of the historical narrative to be rugged individuals, devoid of context, using pure grit to be successful. The stories we tell ourselves shape our notions of possible futures.

When faced with cognitive dissonance, people either change their mind or change reality.
