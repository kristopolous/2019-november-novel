> A page or two that provides an overview of the book's main themes.

I present a historical-heavy theoretical work which attempts to describe how future thought materializes as reality. Defining  future as a redirection of expectations and a redefinition of goals, the future happens when the impossible enters the realm of possible, the absurd becomes commonplace and heresy is redefined.

The hypothesis is that there's frameworks and describable dynamics for orchestrating these divergences. I borrow styles of writing centered around model making that are common in some of the most well respected business books such as Crossing the Chasm, The Innovators Dilemma and Built to Laat.

Their deconstructive approach to describing system dynamics in the behavior of companies and the marketplace I've found to be inspirational.

Also, for the past 20 years, the constellation surrounding the Frankfurt school has greatly influenced me.

That uniquely positions this work as a an interweaving of political economy and markets

 Our time can be described as a People 


> A list of contents, with a short paragraph on each chapter. 

I've divided the work into three sections:

Part I **The Anatomy of a Future**. Part 1 Defines the terms and bootstraps the theories. We go over visions, goals, dreams, futures, hopes, execution, failure, and directions.  A number of helpful rules are established along with how to identify them, think about them, and execute them.

1.1 **What is technology?** Technology is the *mechanism of relationships among people and their environment* (borrowing from gift economics).  It's a physical or fictional (in the legal sense) device that has a describable mechanical nature. Technology may or may not involve a physical object but *it is not the object itself* (borrowing from marx's object fetishization). In the same way that property is the relationship, technology is a mechanism of that relationship. There's three kinds of technologies: tools, processes (interpersonal), and human craft/skills. Together they constitute a "whole technology".

1.2 **What is an idea?** Ideas are abstract destinations with the same properties as physical destinations. They can be an unknown distance and have an unknown nature or be something we are quite familiar with. The soul of the idea is a captured, but abstract state of existence.

1.3 **Constructs and modalities of future-thought.** Ideas and technologies have uneven dissemination and democratization limited not only by people's skills, organizational processes, and tools but also by current imaginaries that incentivize their creation. This can lead to futures stuck in purgatory unable to make the next leap. Ideas begat goals which require an absurdity (to go beyond the current limitations of thought), an audacity (to think it's achievable), a coherency (to ensure a verbal and non-verbal communication to build a movement), and intention (the narrative act).

1.4 **The necessity of illusion.** Illusions are commitments to perception not constrained by the required integrities of reality. They are our closest approximations to experiencable ideas and rely on beliefs that are often more potent than reality.  Stories at their purest form are orchestrations of illusions, theaters for the mind's eye. They have a crisp transmission of thought through a communicated value of being and are the necessary illusion before a future realized.

1.5 **The reach for possible futures.** As opposed to being a linear projection of current metrics ($/gb, miles/kwh), the future is instead inherently about redirection because it requires a break in continuity and a redefinition of goals, a re-imagining of interaction between the people/process/tools through goals which all have something called a "reach distance", the level of effort required to achieve a sustained reality from a specific societal configuration

Part 2 **Futures Past.** Part 2 is dedicated to historical examples showing these patterns of future thought starting from antiquity up to the present. By looking at the history of what was once considered cutting edge technology, such as newspapers, cartography, and constitutions, we can see the multi-century long-play of futures past.

2.1 **The many ends of history.** Discusses how future imaginaries have manifested throughout time often as era exhaustion, they are a proclaimed lack of the imaginary to see possibilities beyond it without the disruptive nature of Future. This form of disruption is explained through systems of beliefs in religion, the state, or the machinery of technological futurebuilding itself.

2.2 **Of codex and constitutions.** Before modern transportation and communication, the rulebook of the political economy itself was the premiere technology. Standardization of currencies and measurements and systems constructed with known expected outcomes gave rise to the alienability of property, the creation of debt for future yield and systems of servitude based on promised futures. They enabled the collective capacity required to construct and administer cities.

2.3 **Reign and Conquest.** A promise of a knowable future with a secured agency becomes the driver of expansion. Cartography and seafaring along with servitude systems of colonialism allow people to settle elsewhere, divorcing from a past, or to expand empires to insulate against uncertainty. This era is a global fight for disagreed upon but knowable futures marked by numerous wars over competing equivalent instrumentation of whole technologies.

2.4 **Newspapers and the great upheaval.** The industrial revolution came as frontiers closed and enclosed, forcing people into urban environments where cheap communication and transportation permitted the democratization effect of century old technologies to form new imaginaries and lead to the upending of monarchical social order such as the second french revolution of 1848.

2.5 **Radio, television, and the internet.** Successive communication tools followed the same trajectories, infiltrating society and empowering social change in much the same way. As they become increasingly commodified, the cost of production decreases empowering smaller organizational structures to become the means of cultural reproduction.

2.6 **The cracked future code.** Although not formally codified, how to instrument the dynamics of people, processes and tools towards future building became a repeatable emulatable structure. This futureshock of *competing futures* diluted the social imaginary into camps competing for futures, much like during mercantilism, but now at a greater abstraction, the empires of the human mind.

Part 3 **Constructing Tomorrow**. Part 3 presents companies and projects I'm currently involved in and how these methods and perspectives can be used to provide meaning and significance to a particular project. It also speculatively proposes what real-world futures will look like based on the long-view analysis presented in the former sections.

3.1 **Calibrating a vision**
3.2 **What is an advertisement?**
3.3 **What is a game?**
3.4 **Of risk and revolution.**
3.5 **The many worlds of tomorrow**

> Some background on the author, or contributors.
 
I'm a software engineer who has worked exclusively in startups since the late 90s. I see a deep connection between the future projects of engineering,  politics, and business and seek to describe them. The interplay between ideas, emergent categories and the means of orchestrating the dynamic topology of possible tomorrows and how they mechanically interoperate has been of great interest to me for a long time.

> A paragraph on what you perceive as the main markets for the book.

This is both a business an a political book. This is both a business an a political book. The subject matter is general but the treatment is technical. The market size for such matters is only limited by the quality and accessibility of its content.


> Information about any competing titles, published or forthcoming, of which you're aware.

There's a sociological subfield named "Science and technology studies" which I've done a fairly decent survey of to try to find similarities in the approach. They mostly focus on the description and analysis of the consequences of the mechanics of technology, using a more conventional 
I've really found inspiration in the approach of the business books of Clayton Christensen (The Innovators Dilemma) and Geoffery Moore (Crossing the Chasm). 


> Your intended writing timetable.

I'm about 35,000 words in over the course of a month and intend to spend probably another 60-90 days on it. My goal for "completion" comes from the French poet Antoine de Saint-Exupery, "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.". It's a consolation of about 15 years of thought and is am expansion of an article I first tried to write in about 2011 but was never satisfied with.
I put it down for 8 years or so and decided to give it another go, in book form.
