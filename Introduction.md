This book is broken up into three sections

Part 1 is where the theory and frameworks of what future is, what it looks like, and how to orchestrate it.

Part 2 has historical examples of future thought starting from antiquity up to the present 

Part 3 presents the companies and projects I'm currently involved in and how these methods and perspectives can be used to provide meaning and significance to a particular project

The hope is to be able to empower people to help forefront ideas and perspectives to constitute a better tomorrow they technology.

Future stuff doesn't come from having new answers, but by asking new questions.
