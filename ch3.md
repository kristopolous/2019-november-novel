The notion of absurdity needs some refinement.

Going back to the 1-9-90 rule we can take those pieces and subdivide them out into a new category we'll call intentionality. Intentionality is elusive and ephemeral.  Laws are differentiated based on the intentionality.  Did someone murderously drive their car into a person out of bloodlust or was it an unfortunate accident? Did a politician do some act in order to benefit themselves or did such a thing just happen by coincidence? Intentionality is a non-tangible thing that arguably exists both outside the act AND as an essential component. It both drives the underlying mechanics, forms the reality but yet doesn't actually exist beyond abstraction.

Intentionality is an extrinsically assigned attribution and an intrinsically directed motivation and is the connective tissue that ties the 1-9-90 pieces together.

Intentionality, at its best is a coherency, clarity, depth and sincerity - it provides a reason for any action where reason here means a story.

When the act of creation is lacking in adequate intentionality, the objects of that creation lack a value of being.  

"Value of being" is the attribution of existence as a disconnected, independent entity where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. An object has a value of being when it can be named, identified, and described by what it is and what it is not. An iPhone 5 has a value of being, the, say LG VX8300 does not.

The value of being is a direct result of the focus of and attention to the intentionality on its creation. The object is a result of the organizational process of the designers.

This is discussed at length in Dynamics of Software Development, 1995, by Jim McCarthy and the Pulitzer Prize winning The Soul of A New Machine, 1981, by Tracy Kidder (the latter of which is quoted in the discussion of this concept in The Innovators Dilemma, 1997, by Clayton M. Christensen).

The object created is a consequence of the process of creating that object. To what degree and under what aspect that process had intentionality is apparent as a thematic feature in the final product.

Recently at the gaming company, we met a guy who wanted to volunteer a redesign of what we made. A few days later he texted us a few screenshots of his design. 

We both thought they were truly awful, just terrible. I tried asking myself why that was both of our reaction. It wasn't the color choices - they were common colors. It wasn't the arrangement of content or fonts, it was common, fairly by the book and easy to understand.

I thought hard about what I didn't like about it. I asked him what the goals were.  He said "something that was simple and intuitive for people to use".  That's our problem!

Broad-based descriptions like "simple and intuitive" are goals of any project, any creation, any thing - they are not things that are specific to some thing.

Al Ries really informed this analysis for me in his classic "22 Immutable laws of marketing" in his 5th chapter on the Law of Focus: You can't narrow the focus with something that doesn't have proponents of the other side. "simple and intuitive" can't be a focus because nobody would say "I really wanted the product to be complicated and unintelligible".  Because there wasn't enough of a narrow, contoured, opinion, there wasn't enough direction to drive a coherency.

As a result, the design was undesigned: it had poor vision, an unrefined intentionality, a lack of goal-oriented orientation that led to what appeared to be ultimately a disconnected thing with a low value of being. As a result there's a lacking notion of independent existence and worth.  

A successful execution would have had a tightness and flow, a coherency of intention, what Robert M. Pirsig calls "quality" in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  In this book, he finds it very daunting that his notion of western thought didn't encompass such a qualitatively discernable but ultimately unmeasurable thing as quality.

45 years later, I'm going to attempt to pick up where he left off. Quality is the intersection of absurdity, intention, audacity, and coherency. Each of these truly intersects, refines, and informs the other in that they must function in concert with one another to get to the ultimate idea of quality, which is a value of being.

I've been on the search when thinking about this about whether absurdity and audacity are a product of the times or a timeless product. The core question is whether in different contexts other words may replace them. 

I realized that without these terms and an insistence on a removal from current reality, there will forever exist the wall of practicality, explored in chapter 1, that confines the existence of something to be a construct of the past and not the building blocks of future realities. That's the true difference between the LG VX8300 and the iPhone, the former is a constitution of the present while the latter is a proposal for the future.

However, if things are merely audacious, merely absurd, but without coherency or intentionality, there is noise in the signal of vision that's transmitted using the object as a medium - there is a lack of clarity and a fuzziness of defition.
