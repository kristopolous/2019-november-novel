The notion of absurdity needs some refinement.

Going back to the 1-9-90 rule we can take those pieces and subdivide them into intentionality. Intentionality is elusive and ephemeral.  Laws are differentiated based on the intentionality of the event.  Did someone murderously drive their car into a person out of bloodlust or was it an unfortunate event? There's a non-tangible thing, that arguably exists both outside the thing itself AND as an essential component.

Intentionality is an extrinsically assigned attribution and an intrinsically directed motivation and is the connective tissue that ties the 1-9-90 pieces together.

When applied without coherency or clarity, depth or sincerity, the object of creation lacks a value of being.  The notion of a "value of being" is the attribution of existence as a disconnected, independent entity where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Focused intentionality is the process of getting there.

Recently at the gaming company, we met a guy who wanted to volunteer a redesign of what we made. A few days later he texted us a few screenshots of his design. They were truly awful, just terrible. I tried asking myself why that was both of our reaction. It wasn't the color choices - they were common colors that are used in lots of success products. It wasn't the arrangement of content, it was a common, fairly by the book arrangement of content - easy to understand.

I thought it was a poor vision, an unrefined intentionality, a lack of goal-oriented orientation that led to what appeared to be ultimately a disconnected design, with a low value of being - a lacking notion of independent existence and worth.  There's a tightness and flow, a coherency of intention behind what Robert M. Pirsig called quality in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  At the time he found it very daunting that his notion of western thought didn't encompass such a qualitatively discernable but ultimately unmeasurable thing.

45 years later, I'm going to attempt to pick up where he left off. Quality is the intersection of absurdity, intention, audacity, and coherency. Each of these truly intersects, refines, and informs the other in that they must function in concert with one another to get to the ultimate idea of quality, which is a value of being.

I've been on the search when thinking about this about whether absurdity and audacity are a product of the times or a timeless product and whether in different contexts other words may replace them.  However without these terms, there will forever exist the wall of practicality, explored in chapter 1, that confines the existence of something to be a construct of the past and not the building blocks of future realities.

However, if things are merely audacious, merely absurd, but without coherency or intentionality, there is noise in the signal of vision that's transmitted using the object as a medium - there is a lack of clarity and a fuzziness of defition.
