I'm instrumental in two companies right now.  The first one is an advertising technology firm that has screens on top of cars and the second one is a gaming company that is trying to make financial games.

I'm a software developer who recently gained interest in the business world not out of any deep drive for competition or to make money, but instead it's how I saw change happen in the world.

As a young engineer I was constantly baffled by how poor executions of rather useless technology which often were just knockoffs of already existing things ended up being these breakthrough successes in the marketplace with hoardes of people liberally using all caps and exclamation points when describing it.

I always looked on with the same question: "How on earth is this news? Why do people want this? What gives?"

About 2013 or so I came up with the 1-9-90 rule to explain this.  Success is 1% idea, 9% implementation, and 90% "marketing" where marketing includes not only the description of the product/place/price/promotion in some traditional "marketing mix" but also the assumed personality of the people developing it, their social connections, the style and colors of things like the documentation website, the size of the tribe that says positive things about it, etc.

In other words, success is 90% bullshit that shouldn't, but absolutely does matter.

The claim of 90% is important because it implies that the other part, as in what the thing actually is and what constitutes it, almost doesn't matter at all.

You can see this in the 90s boy bands. Their idea, yet another love song, identical to hundreds of others, their execution, a quartet in a 100 year old configuration singing a song following a pop format that had been established for 50 years. That part as it turns out, didnt' actually matter at all.

What the boys looked like, what the music video accompanying it looked like, how it was promoted, this was the only determining factor in the success. 

Some of the hit songs of the era, such as the Fugee's Killing me softly, were just a cover song, in this case, with 75 groups, according to wikipedia, prior to the fugees singing the song. Obviously the content, originality, idea, none of this matters. The 76th cover of a 25 year old song was a big hit only because of the marketing, that's the 90% that actually matters.

I first noticed this pattern far earlier, probably in the 90s.  For years I was incensed that the world worked this way, where the symbolic pageantry surrounding the thing was the actual thing of engagement while the substantive thing instead acted as a mere edifice upon which these ceremonies took place but eventually I succumbed to the inanity of it.

If the actually machinery of the world is constituted by these gears of irrelevance, I might as well discover how they operate. I had a sense early on that trying to shoehorn human action into a framework of rationality required the assumption that people are inherently rational - I had become utterly convinced they weren't.

Instead, I saw emotional, impulsive people responding unpredictably to false and incomplete beliefs all around me.

Rational agency, instead of being inherent to the human condition, is a trained capacity, within the capability of human expression, but not cultivated or expressed as some core constituency.

The second company, the gaming one, is just me and one other person. We released one game that didn't totally fail, but we were able to use as a learning platform (which was the objective) in order to find out how to construct something people would play.

Games that have staying power and have been cloned dozens of times usually can be broken up into a madlibs form: "It's a ______ (gerund) game". They usually have somewhere between 1-3 of these gerunds.  Let me give you an example: "It's a running game", "It's a jumping game", "It's a running and jumping game". Lightgun arcade games are "aiming and shooting", tetris is a "packing and organizing" etc.

Using this framework opens up many possibilities to games which have yet to exist or which may already exist but one doesn't see as a game. For instance, what would a "voting" video game look like? That's called reddit, totally exists.

After going through a list of gerunds today, and trying to play on the absurdity thesis, here's a few subversive we came up with:

 * a smoking game: Your a chain smoker trying not to get caught. You need to constantly tap the phone in order to *not* smoke and then make your character hide from the judgemental public.  When you need to discard cigarette butts you have to wait for nobody to look, and then toss them recklessly in the street. Characters include people such as pregnant women, police officers, traffic cops, and others.  The objective is to get through the most cigarettes possible without getting caught.  A wrinkle is sometimes people may ask you for a cigarette, in which case you can give one away, giving you more points, but only if you occasionally engage with the public.
	More subversive: Your character is actually going through EMT, then nursing, then medical school. As you successfully go through packs without getting caught you can go up to head surgeon. 
 
 * a parking game: You work for a valet service and are constantly given cars which all drive very differently. You are tasked with doing things like parallel parking, or backing in very difficult positions all the while random obstacles like babies and cats come out from nowhere. You are free to hit them for a penalty, but then they stick to the car tire and effect the handling. You need to quickly remove the obstacles from the tire before people notice and then discard them, much like the smoking game. Everything is on a timer. If you ding a car, you may lose if the driver notices. If you get back too late, you will get penalized for taking too long. The better you do, the more tips you get. You need to make some threshold of tips in order to progress to the next level, which will be parking with more obstacles.
	More subversive: There are other drivers whose quality of driving is entirely determined by just sheer sexism and racism, mostly. Women would drive worse than men, about say, 80% of the time. Asians and old people would equally drive terribly in different ways - but may statistically be fine.  The worst driver, however, will be a white guy in a business suit driving a white BMW, and that's 100% of them because we all know they're the worse.
 
  * a "fucking" game: You are the town's rasputin, the go to person for infidelity and have missions that include things like sneaking into windows of people who are married or have roommates and then either quickly or quietly doing your business (no explicit sex need be shown, I'm thinking retro graphics). There is always a risk that someone may walk in on you or you'll be discovered some way. As the game progresses you become like the singer in the 1989 video for "Yo No Me Llamo Javier" (My name isn't Javier) by the spanish group Low Tereros Meurtos where a cassanova continues to run into his former lovers, who have children from him, and tries to claim he's someone else. It's effectively a rogue game, where you have to have a balanced strategy in order to progres.
  
  * a "masturbating" game: Perhaps the most subversive of them all, you are a pointdexter like middle school boy who has aspirations to go to an ivy league school - however you are constantly bombarded with sexual urges and you must releive yourself. This would have the art and feel of the classic SNES "zombies ate my neighbors" game. The character has to frequently perform well on tests and exams and can only do so if he can focus. However he gets bombarded with scenes of waterfighting, beach volleyball, and other suggestive things and must find seclusion, much like the fucking game above, to relieve himself to get back to his studies.  Winning the game is when the character doesn't get caught, and gets a straight A+ report card. 
	More subversive: Your character has no concern for the gender of the people, he responds equally to them all and the verbaige in the game has things such as sirens with "warning: maximum horny, masturbate now". If the character goes and takes a test when too horny, he'll get an erection during the exam, sent to the principles office, and fail the exam. 
  
If any of these games existed and got the mechanics right, the absurdity and presentation thesis, if right, would lead to them being runaway successes. The last one is exceptionally difficult to pull off because the premise of the game fundamentally sexualizes depictions of adolescents. 

Going back to the study of business premises however, this isn't outside the teachings of say "BHAG" (Big hairy audacious goals - See Jim Collins books), a clear and compelling goal that makes you feel uncomfortable that looks like it shouldn't and couldn't be achieved. 

There's another premise which drives this, the idea of a "magic service which feels like it should be illegal". These come around every couple years and is one of the biggest indicators of success. Many things could be described like this: airbnb, uber, napster, youtube (for music), myspace (for internet stalking) and instagram (for internet stalking, round 2). Silicon valley even has a term for these now, they call them "pirate companies" ones where technology exploits the fact that it's ahead of the law and gets to scale quickly enough to fend off being legislated illegal by offering a compelling utility function. Sure, that's fine, if we were all libertarians. But instead, the idea of "getting away with magic" premise is a much more useful one to be able to build, which also dovetails with the themes so far.

So here's what we have:

  * Do not be constrained by barriers of practicality. Absurdity should be embraced
  * Success is 90% presentation, 9% execution, and 1% idea
  * The product or service should feel like a kind of magic which ought to be illegal.
