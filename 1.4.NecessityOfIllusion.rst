1.4 The necessity of illusion
---------------------------

Illusions are commitments to perception not constrained by the required integrities of reality.
They have a specific logic and language and are a rich platform of communicating thought. Like the shadows on Plato's cave or Margtittes Pipe that isn't, their power rests in that they exist on the fundamental unit of human thought, the idea.
There is no other cognitive reality beyond belief. We have ornamentation and product packaging to try to claim otherwise but thoughts, beliefs, ideas, and knowledge are merely idiomatic separations of process and not different actual stuff.

Belief in something working, or that it can be done or that it's at hand. Belief in achievability or unachievability. Belief in why a particular investment of time is justified, belief in that it's an investment and that it's a justifiable reason.

This is the stories we are told, tell our selves, and tell others.  It is at its purest form, a story, an illusion of reality. Stories are orchestrations of illusion, theaters for the minds eye. The best ones come indistinguishale from reality. They have a crisp transmission of thought, a communicated value of being, the necessary illusion before a future realized.

There's always a sliding scale between story and reality when reaching for a goal; the distance between them is the "reach distance" or the gulf of illusion. The distance between the beginning and the end is the "goal distance". One of the main goals in developing new products is to narrow the reach distance. This can be done in one of two ways:

- Have more reality to require less illusion 

- Decrease the reach distance

This model, although easy to understand, needs some nuance. Goals aren't material, they are idealized. They should be impractical and unattainable because they work as a collection of principles that constitute a value of being.  The manifestations should be approximations of the thought stuff.  If they are exact hits, then it isn't future enough.

Current reality must be aside to accommodate enough space to dream and imagine future worlds.
